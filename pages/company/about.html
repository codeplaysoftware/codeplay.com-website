                <h1>About</h1>
            </header>

            <p>Codeplay&reg; Software has been at the forefront of designing and implementing open source,
                standards-based software for HPC and AI since 2002.</p>

            <p>The rise of AI and ever-more powerful compute systems has led to an increasing demand for targeted
                processing achieved with GPUs and specialised accelerators. This presents challenges for software
                developers, who must navigate closed source, proprietary codebases for this diverse hardware. That’s
                why Codeplay is working on open source compilers, libraries and tools that allow software engineers
                to quickly develop across heterogeneous processor systems with a single, portable source code –
                while at the same time conforming to the latest industry standards for safety and performance. </p>

            <p>Industry defined and agreed open standards are at the heart of Codeplay’s mission, extending SYCLTM
                and the oneAPI ecosystem, and the newly formed Unified Acceleration Foundation (UXL) created with
                other industry leaders to jointly drive the next generation of accelerated software solutions.</p>

            <p>In 2022, Codeplay was acquired by Intel&reg; – and joined their mission to deliver greater performance,
                choice and innovation for developers with oneAPI. With Intel, Codeplay is continuing to deliver on
                our vision of a fully open software ecosystem for HPC and artificial intelligence (AI). </p>
