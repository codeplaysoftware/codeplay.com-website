                <p>With increasing heterogeneity in processor hardware, it is very crucial to be able to run
                    the same code across different architectures. Even more important is to be able to
                    port the applications without loss of performance. SYCL is a C++ based heterogenous
                    programming model which has many compiler implementations and hence supports a
                    wide variety of hardware platforms. It becomes imperative to write kernels which can
                    achieve good performance on all these different platforms.</p>
                <p>SYCL-BLAS and SYCL-DNN show an approach of writing modular SYCL kernels based on template
                    meta programming. These kernels are templated on various hardware specific parameters
                    like tile sizes, work group size, cache line size, etc. When deploying the code on a
                    new hardware, these parameters can be tuned to achieve best performance.</p>

                <p>RISC-V architecture provides a modular design of layered and extensible ISA. It provides
                    flexibility to customize processors for a specific functionality. However, programming
                    model support for RISC-V accelerators has been minimal due to its initial stages. At
                    Codeplay, we provide an open standard way of offloading kernels to RISC-V accelerators
                    using the Acoran stack. The Acoran stack consists of ComputeMUX which provides the
                    driver interface required to run SYCL code on RISC-V cores, ComputeCPP which is a SYCL
                    compiler and SYCL-BLAS and SYCL-DNN libraries which contain optimized kernels for
                    common neural network operations. This architecture allows for running neural network
                    ONNX models (with the SYCL backend for ONNX Runtime) on RISC-V accelerators. </p>

                <p>Integrating of Codeplay’s leading SYCL compiler/runtime with the most recent open source
                    MLIR version to provide a tool with a more flexible way of reasoning about programs
                    so they can be more easily ported to different architectures. The implementation will be
                    able to explore efficiently the space of possible transformations, without having to
                    change the source of the program, so the tool can adapt it to better fit the
                    hardware capabilities. </p>
