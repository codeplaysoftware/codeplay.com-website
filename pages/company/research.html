                <p>Codeplay Research was set up in early 2013 to investigate and research advanced compiler and
                    software technologies as well as predict future standards and platforms.
                    Working with our partners, we have developed a number of core technologies and
                    foundations.</p>

                <p>PEPPHER is unique in proposing direct compilation to the target architectures.
                    Portability is supported by powerful composition methods and a toolbox of adaptive algorithms.
                    Heterogeneity is further managed by advanced auto-tuning mechanisms and efficient run-time
                    schedulers. The PEPPHER framework will thus ensure that applications execute with maximum
                    efficiency on each supported platform.</p>
