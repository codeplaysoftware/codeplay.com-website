                    Codeplay has the experience and skills to design and implement debuggers for a variety of
                    processors and custom hardware.</h2>

                <h2>Implementation from Start to Finish</h2>
                <p>Codeplay can develop debuggers from scratch, or leverage projects such as GDB or LLDB.
                    Debuggers are tied to compilers in various ways, and we can ensure your customers have
                    the debugging features they demand. Whether it be command line, GUI, or integration into
                    other popular IDEs we have the expertise you require.</p>

                <h2>Heterogeneous Hardware Debuggers</h2>
                <p>Even difficult targets can have debuggers implemented for them. Our wealth of experience in
                    developing compilers allows us to compile for targets in such a way that a worthwhile and
                    valuable debugging experience can be provided.</p>

                <h2>Custom Development Tools</h2>
                <p>Whatever hardware you are creating, the ability for developers to probe and inspect run-time
                    state is essential. We can consult on your platform and work out a plan to offer your customers
                    tailored development tools explicitly targeted at the unique features of your hardware.</p>
