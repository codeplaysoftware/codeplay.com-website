                <p>SYCL&trade; is a programming model that lets developers support a wide variety of devices (CPUs,
                    GPUs,
                    and more) from a single code base. Given the growing heterogeneity of processor roadmaps,
                    moving to a platform-independent model such as SYCL is essential for modern software developers.
                    SYCL has the further advantage of supporting a single-source style of programming from completely
                    standard C++.</p>
                <p>Codeplay has been involved with SYCL from the original definition of the standard in 2014 and have
                    developed ComputeCpp&trade;, the first SYCL v1.2.1 conformant implementation. Our engineers are
                    working
                    with SYCL code on a daily basis and can use that experience to help your developers become SYCL
                    experts.</p>
                <p>Codeplay can organize training programmes to suit all environments and all levels of experience.
                    Explore, prototype and design with SYCL then transform your code to run on parallel and
                    heterogeneous systems.</p>
