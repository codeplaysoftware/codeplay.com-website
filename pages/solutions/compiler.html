                </header>
                <p>Codeplay build, optimize and verify compilers for the full range of processor
                    architectures, from CPUS to GPUs, DSPs, and other customer accelerators. Working
                    together, Codeplay can help you build, optimize and test your compiler, ensuring
                    high performance and standards conformance across the board.</p>
                <p>We have developed a number of compilers based on the open-source Clang/LLVM technology
                    and for over a decade with our legacy VectorC proprietary compiler technology. Whatever
                    your choice, Codeplay has the experience and skill to make your compiler a reality.</p>

                <h2>Optimization</h2>
                <p>Codeplay can work with you to create a compiler that will fully utilize the available
                    hardware. A more efficient compiler will increase battery life, improve performance
                    and reduce chip degradation, ultimately improving end-user experience.</p>

                <p>Codeplay offers industry-leading services in compiler testing. Whether testing for compiler
                    correctness, performance tracking, conforming to standards or tracking runtime behaviour
                    across products - we can test your compiler and provide a thorough analysis of what we find.</p>
