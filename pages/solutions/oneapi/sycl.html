                <h2>SYCL is a royalty-free, cross-platform abstraction layer parallel to ISO C++. With SYCL, you can
                    write high-performing code that runs across different hardware targets, with support for custom
                    tuning to specific accelerators. It is open standard, maintained collaboratively by cross-industry
                    working groups. Several open source implementations of SYCL have been created, such as the
                    DPC++ project that is part of the oneAPI Base Toolkit. </h2>
