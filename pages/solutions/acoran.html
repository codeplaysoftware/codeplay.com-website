                <h1>Acoran: The Standards-Based Platform for Exascale and AI</h1>
                <p>Building products like self-driving-cars or supercomputers requires very high performance software
                    and hardware. This is only possible with a fully-featured software platform that provides:
                    programmability, optimized processor-specific routines and a wide ecosystem of domain-specific
                    optimized libraries. All of this needs to be high performance, well maintained and constantly
                    tested. Codeplay believes this is only possible with a mix of open-standard and open-source
                    software. Acoran integrates all the open-standards, open-source libraries and device-specific
                    optimized routines that developers need, all in a fully-tested, supported and maintained
                    package.</p>
                <p>Acoran is the production-ready, fully-open software platform for exascale and artificial
                    intelligence. Compatible with a wide range of open standards (SYCL™, OpenCL™, SPIR-V™ and oneAPI)
                    as well as supporting high quality full-featured frameworks like TensorFlow™ or Eigen;
                    Acoran takes software acceleration out of the lab and into production.

                <h1>Why Use Acoran?</h1>
                <p><b>Building your AI or HPC product with Acoran means it will be high performance, standards compliant
                    and production quality. Acoran integrates all the open standard technologies required to leverage
                    accelerator processors with all the open-source libraries needed to write AI and HPC software all
                    in a fully-tested, integrated platform.</b></p>
                <p>The Acoran platform is fully open and programmable. Everything in Acoran is either open standard or
                    open-source. The Acoran platform is also tested for each accelerator we support, with extensive
                    platform validation to ensure that everything is production quality and ready to go. </p>
                <p>The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is stimulating the development of processor and
                    accelerator hardware designs, while software frameworks are adapting to keep pace with the
                    latest machine learning techniques.</p>
                <p>In order to take advantage of this AI revolution, processors and accelerators need to offer
                    compatible solutions for software developers that integrate with existing software frameworks
                    and technologies.</p>
                <p>Codeplay's Acoran provides all the performance and programmability solutions that accelerator
                    processors need, delivering a software platform that accelerates a range of AI software on a
                    wide range of hardware platforms using industry standards.</p>
                <p>Codeplay has been involved in the definition of industry open standards since 2002, developing
                    many solutions using them, and gaining a reputation as a leader in enabling the latest
                    processors. Codeplay is especially focused on the SYCL, OpenCL, SPIR-V and ISO C++ standards
                    where the company has made significant contributions. These open standards are being used to
                    enable the latest AI software and make full use of the performance of the latest processors and
                    accelerators.</p>
                <p>The technology Codeplay develops is also being used in High Performance Computing (HPC) to enable
                    acceleration of complex scientific software.</p>
                <p>Codeplay is already working extensively with processor companies and is capable of delivering the
                    Acoran platform for processors supplied by, but not limited to, Intel, AMD&reg;, Nvidia&reg;,
