                <h2>Whilst developing compilers for your custom microprocessor designs, Codeplay
                    feeds back information on optimizations that could be made at the hardware
                    level to increase your processing power and throughput. Codeplay has experience
                    of building optimizing compilers for CPUs, GPUs, DSPs and other custom accelerators,
                    and uses this expertise to advise on how programming models map to your architecture.
                    Performance bottlenecks can be identified via detailed early analysis, saving
                    manufacturers time and money.</h2>
