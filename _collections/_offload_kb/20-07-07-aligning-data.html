<p>Aligning data within an Offload&trade; context can provide a wealth of optimization opportunites for the compiler. The Playstation 3 SPUs are most efficient when operating on data aligned to at least 16 bytes.  Offload&trade; is able to perform more optimizations on data accesses when it knows the alignment of the data.Offload&trade; supports both the Microsoft Visual Studio __declspec(align(#)) and GCC __attribute__((aligned((#)))) specifiers to increase the alignment of types and variables.<strong>Increasing the alignment of data accessed inside Offloaded code to 16 bytes or more results in:</strong>
</p><ul>
<li> Fewer reads from the software cache,</li>
</ul><ul>
<li> Faster memcpy's</li>
</ul><ul>
<li> Higher performance memory access intrinsics</li>
</ul>
