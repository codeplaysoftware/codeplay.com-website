<p>One of the most useful features of Offload is being able to call a function on PPU from SPU using __outer_call.
</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;liboffload&gt;
static int foo() __outer_call;

static int func()
{
	offloadThread_t handle = __offload()
	{
		int bar = foo(); // calls back onto the PPU and performs its execution there
	};
}
</code></pre><p>In the above example, the function foo will have its execution performed on the PPU, before returning the result back within the Offload&trade; context. This may be useful for example for PPU memory allocations from the SPU.Some restrictions apply on functions with the outer_call attribute.
</p><ul>
<li> cannot be virtual methods</li>
<li> all pointer variables must be outer pointers (pointers to main memory)</li>
<li> the this pointer (if a non-static member function) must be an outer pointer</li>
<li> all duplicated types must be outer</li>
</ul><p>
__outer_call is simply a define to __attribute__((outer_call)) within the library header.
</p><p>
Note that outer calls interrupt the PPU, so doing many outer calls severly impact performance!
