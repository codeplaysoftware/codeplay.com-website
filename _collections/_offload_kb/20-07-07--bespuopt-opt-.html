<p>It is often useful to compile the output C code with extra command line options. For instance, it can be quite useful to compile the SPU code through GCC with &ndash;fstack-check, which provides more robust stack checking code. &ndash;BEspuopt:&lt;opt&gt; (where is the option to pass onto SPU GCC, without the first -) allows us to pass these options on, for example to pass the &ndash;fstack-check option on SPU GCC we would use &ndash;BEspuopt:fstack-check.
