<p><strong>&quot;Help! I try to run an __offload block but at runtime I get DOMAIN_ENTRY_NOT_FOUND printed to the TTY!&quot;</strong>Any runtime error that prints DOMAIN_ENTRY_NOT_FOUND from the SPU means there is a problem with a virtual function within your code.Offload&trade; requires all virtual functions that are called from within an __offload block are specified within the __offload domain (see <a href="{{ '/kb/32' | relative_url }}">/kb/32.html</a> for further details).

<p>
A helpful command line option that will show all the virtual functions called from within an offload block can be found at <a href="{{ '/kb/25' | relative_url }}">/kb/25.html</a>.
