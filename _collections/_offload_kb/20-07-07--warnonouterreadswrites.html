<p>This commandline option makes the Offload compiler print warning messages on slow PPU memory accesses from the SPU. The information printed includes size, alignment and access type (reads,writes,memcopys). Having this inormation is very useful for the programmer to spot performance bottlenecks, find unaligned data, fragmented memory accesses.
