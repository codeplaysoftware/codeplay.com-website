<p>Using the -warnonouterreadswrites command line option will output to the compiler output all instances of __outer reads and writes from within Offload blocks. All these reads and writes will go via the software cache, unless they are listed as being memory copies.
</p><p>
This output is very useful for detecting slow reads and writes. One vital aspect is the alignment of the data. If you discover many reads and writes of a size which is greater than the listed alignment of that operation, the software cache cannot deduce that all the requested data exists on a single cache line, and must go through a slower path to guarantee correctness.
</p><p>
Using this list then to eliminate these reads and writes by either aligning the data to better boundaries, or grouping reads and writes, can yield speed-up.
