<p>Offload supports the PPU altivec instrinsics in its entirety, and also performs optimizations above and beyond what GCC and SNC can do!By using knowledge of the alignment of data and what an altivec intrinsic is trying to do, the Offload compiler can perform vastly improved performance improvments and crucially for the SPU reduces code size too!
