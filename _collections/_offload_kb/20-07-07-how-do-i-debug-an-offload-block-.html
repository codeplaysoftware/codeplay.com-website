<p>Offload&trade; blocks go through extensive modifcation to allow for ease of migration, but this has the trade off that generated code can be quite hard to track and follow.
</p><p>
You can debug Offload blocks like any other SPU job/thread/task. The offloadPause() function within &lt;liboffload&gt; may be used to cause a trap instruction on PPU or SPU to aid debugging. The call-stack should be fully visible, although function names may have additional suffixes to indicate __inner or __outer function pointer parameters, or indicate the memory location of the this pointer of method functions.
</p><p>
You can step through Offload generated SPU code like normal, and appearing will be the PPU source it was generated from. Type information is however lost - it is generally compared to debugging optimized code.
