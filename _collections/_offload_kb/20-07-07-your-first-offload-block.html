<p>Regardless of how you decided to install Offload™, the first offload block that is attempted is a good sanity test for your installation.
</p><p>
Whether you decide to jump right in and integrate Offload™ with your current project, or you would rather create a project from scratch, it is advisable to start small and ensure the installation is working as is expected!
</p><p>
The first step is to create an C++ file, which will be compiled with Offload™. Once you have the given C++ file created, the next step is to set it to use Offload™. When using the Visual Studio 2008 integration, you can right-click on the desired file and select 'Activate Offload', or you could use a custom build step as either a Visual Studio custom build step, or within a makefile.
</p><p>
Create a function within your file:
</p>
<pre><code>
#include
#include
void offloadTestBlock()
{
	__blockingoffload()
	{
		printf(&quot;Hello world from the SPU!&quot;);
	};
}
</code></pre><p>By creating a corresponding header file to expose the function elsewhere in your code, or simply by using an extern offloadTestBlock();, you can link the offloaded function with your normal game code.When using Visual Studio 2008 Integration, compiling the file as is normal will suffice to build the example.
</p>

<p>
<div class="ps3"></p><p>
Content Has been removed.
</div>
</p><p>
Now compiling this example will create a blocking SPU job which simply prints 'Hello world!' to the console.
</p>
