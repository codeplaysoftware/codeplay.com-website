If the Offload&trade; Installer was used, and the Compiler Controller was installed, you can simply use the Visual Studio AddIn to enable Offload&trade; on a file in the solution. This is often the easiest way to quickly learn how to use Offload&trade;.
</p>

<p>
<img src="{{ '/public/uploaded/public/activateoffload.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Untitled"/>Open the Solution Explorer and navigate to a C++ file of your choice. Right clicking on the file, a new menu option for &lsquo;Activate Offload&rsquo; should be visible, click this option. Now Offload&trade; will be used to compile the file you selected. Offload&trade; will build the file solely for PPU until an __offload block is inserted into the code however.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Please note</strong> that you do not have to use the Offload&trade; plugin but it is recommended if you are trying Offload&trade; for the first time. You can also easily invoke Offload&trade; via the console integrated with your internal build systems.
