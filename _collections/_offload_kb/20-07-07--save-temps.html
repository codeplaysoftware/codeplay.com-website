<p>Offload implements the &ndash;save-temps compiler option (<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Debugging-Options.html">from gcc</a>) that preprocesses the input file and saves the output as a .i file in the same directory that the source files resides in. This is extremely handy when a customer thinks they have an issue with some of our Offloaded code, they can preprocess the file and send it to us here at Codeplay, which allows us to see exactly what the problem is by compiling the example ourselves, and provide help as to what the problems encountered with the example are.
