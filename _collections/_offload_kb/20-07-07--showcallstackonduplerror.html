<p>Duplication errors can be given extra context by adding the &ndash;showcallstackonduplerror compiler option. This option will show the exact path followed to get to the duplication error, and it often gives that little bit extra compiler advice that can be required to get around duplication errors (at the expense of making the error messages much more verbose!)
