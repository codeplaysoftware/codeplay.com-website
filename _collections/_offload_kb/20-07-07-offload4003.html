<p><strong>Arguments to __offload blocks cannot be indirections from another variable (Argument # is an indirection from &lt;name&gt; )</strong>
</p><p>
This error occurs if a class member variable is included in the argument list. Class members can be used without being in the argument list, the &lsquo;this&rsquo; pointer of a class instance is implicitly added to a argument list.
