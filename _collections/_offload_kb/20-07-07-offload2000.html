<p>This error occurs when a return statement is encountered inside an __offload block that would cause the flow of control to leave the __offload block. Return is currently supported for blocking offload thread blocks but not for non-blocking __offload blocks. Return statements with values are currently not supported for any offload thread block but support for these return statements may be added for blocking __offload blocks in a later release.
</p>
