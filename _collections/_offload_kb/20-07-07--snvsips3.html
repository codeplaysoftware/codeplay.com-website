<p>The -snvsips3 command line option is used to switch Offload into the <strong>SN V</strong>isual <strong>S</strong>tudio <strong>I</strong>ntegration for <strong>P</strong>lay<strong>S</strong>tation <strong>3</strong> mode, which means for a given input C++ file, an object/elf file type is produced. The option will make Offload&trade; automatically call the produced OutputC compile.bat, negating the need for the user to explicity perform that operation.
