<p>Whilst Offload&trade; will quickly allow developers to migrate lots of code onto SPU, it is not in the way of achieving hand-tuned SPU C/C++ performance. All SPU intrinsics are supported, as well as si_ intrinsics, and in certain cases due to the fully optimizing nature of the Offload&trade; VectorC compiler engine, can yield benefits over hand-tuned C.
