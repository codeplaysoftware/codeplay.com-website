<h3>This virtual call or pointer call may fail due to a missing domain. The __offload block declared at % must have a domain attached to be able to offload functions, for example __offload [&amp; myfunction] { ....</h3><p>This warning is issued if a domain declaration is missing on an __offload block .
</p>
<pre><code>int (* ptr)();

void test()
{
	__offload  //missing domain
	{
		ptr(); // call that requires domain
	}
}
</code></pre><p>Avoid this warning by adding an appropriate domain (containing the function that is called through ptr) to the __offload block.
