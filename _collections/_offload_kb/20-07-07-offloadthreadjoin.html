<pre><code>int offloadThreadJoin(offloadThread_t threadID);
</code></pre>
<p>
Joins an Offload block to the current running thread.
</p><p>
If the Offload block is still running, the caller PPU thread will sleep for a certain time before attempting to join again. This time can be modified with offloadSetUSleepTime and offloadGetUSleepTime functions, which have global scope. If you want to change the amount of time a thread will sleep locally for this threadID only, try using offloadThreadJoinWithSleep, or if you prefer to manage manually what to do when joining fails, use offloadThreadTryJoin.
</p><p>
If the current running thread is running fibers, it will attempt to yield the fiber to another instead of sleeping.
</p><p>
A non-zero return value indicates an error has occured. If an invalid threadID is provided, behaviour is undefined.
