<p>Sets the number of software cache sets log2, meaning 2^n cache sets are used. EG. -cachesets=7 would mean 2^7 sets would mean 128 cache sets, and 64kB of data used. Legal values are 0..7, default is 3.Varying the software cache size can increase performance at the cost of increase memory. For large binaries, a smaller software cache might be used to fit the binary into the memory constraints, whereas for smaller binaries a large cache could be used to gain performance.
