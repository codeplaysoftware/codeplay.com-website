<p>The liboffload header contains all definitions required by offload to set up the runtime, join offload blocks, and tailor the system to your needs. It also defines intrinsic mappings, optimized library functions and libraries such as the cache manipulation library liboffload::swcache, and data locality library liboffload::data.
</p><p>
The liboffload header should be the first include in any file where its features are required for best compatibility.
