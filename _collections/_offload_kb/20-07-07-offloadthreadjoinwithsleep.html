<pre><code>int offloadThreadJoinWithSleep(unsigned int threadID, unsigned int us)
</code></pre>
<p>
Joins an Offload block to the current running thread.

This call does not manage the use of fibers. If joining cannot be done instantly, the calling PPU thread will sleep for us microseconds.
</p><p>
A non-zero return value indicates an error has occured. If an invalid threadID is provided, behaviour is undefined.
