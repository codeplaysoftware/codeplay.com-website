<p>When Offload compiles to the intermediate output C format, the generated C files are placed into a folder for further compilation. To specify the destination of this folder use the &ndash;ocdir [dir] compiler option. For example, to place the files into the folder Foo, use &ndash;ocdir &ldquo;Foo&rdquo;. The double quotes are optional here, but are recommended in case the path specified has spaces within it.
