<p>Non-static member methods (more precisely the SPU version the Offload compiler generates) called inside offload blocks on outer values will have an __outer this pointers. If that called method heavily processes data off the this pointer it will impact the performance of the offloaded code.
</p><p>
The -warnouterthiscalls option is useful to spot the &quot;root&quot; call so that it can be replaced with a call on a SPU-locally cached object instead. For example on the source code in <a href="{{ '/kb/147' | relative_url }}">/kb/147.html</a> the compiler prints these warnings:
</p>
<pre><code>*** WARNING: Outer this pointer passed to functions call: cross .
--- In file: cross.cpp, at line: 18, column: 9
       va$r = global.cross(global);
*** WARNING: Outer this pointer passed to functions call: operator= .
--- In file: cross.cpp, at line: 18, column: 9
       va$r = global.cross(global);
</code></pre><p>The first warning is generated for calling vec3::cross on the PPU variable global, and the second warning come from the assignment to the PPU variable var which calls the compiler-generated assignment operator.
