<p>Virtual methods can be called from inside a offload block. This requires the called method to be offloaded (already present on the SPU on PS3). Virtual methods are offloaded by adding them to a virtual domain <a href="{{ '/kb/132' | relative_url }}">/kb/132.html</a> which is attached to the offload block.
