<p>Offload&trade; is currently installable in two seperate ways.Firstly, the Offload&trade; installer is a full blown all bells and whistles windows installer, taking you through the step by step installation process. The Offload&trade; installer allows the user to select the usual where to install, what to install, and crucially sets the required environment variables for compiling with Offload&trade;.Alternatively, a zip file of the latest build is provided as is, where the onus is on you, the developer, to place the compiler executable and offload sdk in a directory of your choice, and then set the required environment variables.
