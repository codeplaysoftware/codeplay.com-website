<p>Offload&trade; can be used as a custom build step in Visual Studio or in a makefile, it is just a compiler that takes input files and compiler options and produces an object file.When using Offload&trade; as a custom build step, ensure that the correct environment variables have been set prior to performing the operation. Some developers using Offload&trade; have found that having a wrapper batch file to set the required variables prior to execution is useful, and below you will find an example batch file you could use!
</p>
<pre><code>@echo off

setlocal

set OFFLOADFOLDER=%~dp0
set SIEVE_PS3_SDK=%OFFLOADFOLDER%offload-sdk

if not &quot;%PATH%&quot;==&quot;&quot; set PATH=;%PATH%
set PATH=%OFFLOADFOLDER%%PATH%

if not &quot;%INCLUDE%&quot;==&quot;&quot; set INCLUDE=;%INCLUDE%
set INCLUDE=%OFFLOADFOLDER%offload-sdkinclude%INCLUDE%

set CMDS=%*
set OCDIR=

set TMP=%1&quot; &quot;
set TMP=%TMP:&quot;=%

:loop

if &quot;%TMP%&quot;==&quot; &quot; goto continue

if &quot;%TMP%&quot;==&quot;-ocdir &quot; set OCDIR=%~2

shift
set TMP=%1&quot; &quot;
set TMP=%TMP:&quot;=%

goto loop

:continue

if not &quot;%OCDIR%&quot;==&quot;&quot; rmdir /S /Q &quot;%OCDIR%&quot;

%OFFLOADFOLDER%offloadps3cpp.exe %CMDS%
</code></pre><p>The above batch file example assumes that the offload-sdk folder is in the same folder as the OffloadPS3CPP.exe executable and the batchfile, and that the batchfile is being called with a fully qualified path, e.g. 'C:yourpath	ooffloadatchfile.bat'. It will also attempt to remove the previous iterations OutputC folder, as is recommended.
