<p><strong>VectorC{PC} Pro has been discontinued and is no longer available. Support enquiries from existing licensees will still be accepted.</strong>
</p><p>
VectorC is a high performance C/C++ compiler which offers the fastest possible gains from the latest in processor features without having to use assembly language!
</p><h2>Features</h2><ul><li> Create super-fast SSE, SSE2, MMX and 3DNow! enhanced applications from standard C/C++ source code </li>
<li> Mix and match between VectorC{PC}, Visual C/C++ 6.0 and GCC compiled C/C++ source code</li>
<li> Codeplay Portable Intrinsics let you develop vector code that can be recompiled for all PC processors and PlayStation®2 as well</li>
</ul><p>
VectorC{PC} 2.0 does not support C++ exception handling or run-time-type information at this time. These will be added later.
</p><h2>Vectorization</h2><p>VectorC recognises parallelisms in standard C/C++ source code and generates vectorized code for the supported CPUs. As a 'smart compiler', VectorC automatically utilises advanced CPU features and negates the need for time consuming assembly language programming.
</p><h2>Codeplay Portable Intrinsics</h2><p>VectorC{PC} also supports our Codeplay Portable Intrinsics. These intrinsic functions generate vector instructions from C/C++ source code. But, they are portable, so you can recompile for different vector instruction sets and even non-vector instruction sets as well. All from the same source code!
</p><h2>Compatibility</h2><p>VectorC is normally used within Microsoft Visual Studio™ 6.0 , and offers 100% compatibility. It can be used as a replacement for the Microsoft Visual C/C++ compiler, either over the whole project or on a per-file basis.
