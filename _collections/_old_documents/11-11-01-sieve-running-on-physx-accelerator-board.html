<p>Codeplay has demonstrated its Sieve Parallel Processing Compiler running on a PhysX&trade; accelerator chip at the Spring Processor Forum in San Jose.  The Sieve system is able to compile C++ programs to exploit the parallel processing capabilities of AGEIA's PhysX&trade; physics accelerator chip.  The demonstration proves that the Sieve System can easily be ported to and fully exploit the capabilities of unusual and novell processor architectures.
