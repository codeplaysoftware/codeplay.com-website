<p>Codeplay has successfully demonstrated its <a href="index.php?Itemid=184">Sieve Parallel Processing Compiler</a> operating on Sony's Cell Processor.  The demonstration, using a Sony PlayStation&reg;3, ran under Yellow Dog Linux.  The demonstration proved that the Sieve system offers a clear linear performance advantage on multicore processor architectures, and that programs written in <a href="index.php?Itemid=184">Sieve C</a> are portable and scalable.

The demonstration code, originally written for x86 processor, was ported to the PlayStation&reg;3 with only minor modifications and executed.  The test programs were initially run across a single SPE, and subsequently, without any further modification, run across 6 SPE's.  The results indicated a linear performance increase, with all 6 processing elements being exploited fully in parallel.
