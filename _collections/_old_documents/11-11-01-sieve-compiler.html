<p>The Sieve Compiler is a powerful tool which lies at the heart of the sieve code partitioning system. The compiler not only automatically generates multi-core ready C code from platform independent C++ source code, it also helps the programmer to mark up their code with Sieve extensions, providing advice in removing dependencies and getting the best multi-core performance out of their algorithms.

<strong>Features</strong>
</p><ul>
<li> Generates auto-parallelized <a href="{{ '/drupal_codeplay/?q=node/78' | relative_url }}">ANSI C code</a> with processor specific optimizations, ready to be compiled with existing C compilers</li>
<li> Compile-time checking of pointer and function types</li>
<li> Provides advice to the programmer, assisting them in adding sieve blocks and sieve thread blocks to their code</li>
<li> Automatic compiler guided code refactoring</li>
<li> Can be operated as a stand-alone command line tool or can integrate with common IDE's</li>
</ul>
