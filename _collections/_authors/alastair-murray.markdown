Alastair, VP of Product Engineering, is responsible for the development of Codeplay's products and 
involvement in standards bodies.

He holds a PhD in Informatics, focussed on compiler design, from the University of Edinburgh and went on to 
do further research in compilation for heterogeneous systems before joining Codeplay in 2014. At Codeplay he 
was involved in setting up research projects, leading the development of the ComputeAorta toolkit for 
implementing OpenCL and Vulkan compute, and contributing to writing the OpenCL specification.

Now as the VP of Product Engineering he works together with the product development teams to continue to 
push the quality and capabilities of Codeplay's heterogeneous language and compiler products, drive 
involvement in the standards for those languages, and accelerate machine learning libraries ready for 
customer platforms.
