At Codeplay I am responsible for implementing the SYCL runtime, occasionally dabbling with a little compiler development on the side. I spend some my time presenting, collaborating and supporting people with SYCL within and outwith the company.

I am also involved in the standardization of the Khronos SYCL specification.

In my spare time I enjoy playing and creating games, board games and walking my dogs.
