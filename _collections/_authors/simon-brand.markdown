Working on tools for HSA. Spec editor for the Tools Group and writing a prototype LLDB implementation.

I can often be found on StackOverflow or at the Edinburgh C++ meetups discussing template metaprogramming.

Most of my spare time is spent getting crawled on by a silly toddler, watching 80s horror films, or both.
