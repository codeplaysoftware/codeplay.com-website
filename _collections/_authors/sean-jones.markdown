At Codeplay, I am responsible for managing, the CI (continuous integration) systems. I work with our teams, helping create or improve their development workflows.

Creating standardized build environments, which provide our developers, with a reliable CI system. Building tools to help automate and aid project development. 

Being able to work with our developers, providing tools and methodologies to improve their productivity.

At home, I aspire to build rockets and autonomous vehicles.
