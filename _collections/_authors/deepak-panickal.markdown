Debugger Team Lead, with four years of experience at Codeplay. More recently, led the team for adapting the LLDB debugger for supporting the Qualcomm Hexagon DSP.

Over the years at Codeplay, I have had the opportunity to work in commercial and research projects, related to low-level tools in various heterogeneous architectures.

Apart from the world of computers, socializing with friends and family, cooking, and reading/conversing about anything under the sun include a few of my favorite past times.

I love working with people, motivating them, and getting things done on time!
