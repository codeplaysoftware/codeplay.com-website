I oversee the development of all engineering projects within the company. Before taking on my current role, I worked on many diverse projects, including creating our in-house testing system, Testplay, helping with development of the car damage engine in NASCAR The Game on PlaystationÂ®3 and Xbox 360, and working on various compiler and heterogeneous computing projects for major technology companies.

The most fulfilling part of my role at Codeplay has been mentoring our new staff and helping them become part of our family.

I'm proud to have been a part of the development of our company over the past decade, developing our expertise in very complex technology without losing our culture of being innovative, agile, and most of all, friendly.

I'm excited by the possibilities of automation to help us create, build, test, deliver, and manage our software, and strive to constantly increase our development processes' quality and efficiency.

I also strive to improve my five-a-side football performance, however this is proving to be rather less successful! In my spare time, I love going to concerts, running and climbing.
