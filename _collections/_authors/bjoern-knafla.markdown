Currently I am leading an amazing team of compiler and runtime specialists to adapt ComputeSuite to a customer chip. We are providing OpenCL 1.2, SYCL 1.2, and implement a LLVM-based C/C++ compiler.

Parallel programming has to become easier! To make heterogeneous platforms more accessible I designed and implemented programming frameworks and drivers. My speciality is OpenCL for mobile and embedded systems.

Books! I love books.
