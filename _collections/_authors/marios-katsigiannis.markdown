I started programming at the age of 11 on GWBasic on an IBM compatible and then on DOS QBasic. I quickly moved to Visual Basic 6 and ended up with C and a little C++, while still on Secondary School. I was admitted to Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB) in 2006, where I learned Java (1.5 and 1.6 at the time) and kept mastering C++. From that time I also started working first on small Greek businesses using Visual Basic .Net and/or C# and SQL Server, and then as a freelancer tackling a variety of software development projects. While still on University, I developed a modular system for managing 3d graphics tasks and used it in my undergrad thesis on Video Processing using 3D Graphics technics. After completing my mandatory military service, I studied for an MSc on Computer Systems Management at Heriot-Watt University of Edinburgh, focusing on High Performance Computing and Big Data. My MSc thesis was focused on mining Twitter data and analysing them using Apache Hadoop.
