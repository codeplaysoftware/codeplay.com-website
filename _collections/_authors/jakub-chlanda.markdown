At Codeplay Jakub works at the sharp edge between heterogeneous runtimes and compilers for mobile and embedded systems. Often launching himself into dark corners of both.

Legend has it, that Jakub holds an MEng degree in Forest Management and Engineering and that he was dyn_cast'ed to a Software Engineer.

Whatever you do, do not point Jakub in a direction of an overhanging limestone cliff, he will try to climb it!
