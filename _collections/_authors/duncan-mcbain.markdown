I am currently working on Codeplay's ComputeCPP and am a great believer in the SYCL specification!

Previously, I worked on research projects as well as testing for various other projects in the company.

I'm quite interested in compiled languages that aren't C++ outside of work.

I like going to concerts, and can also be found enjoying the company of friends with a good board game or two.
