At Codeplay, I focus on creating and optimising LLVM backends for customers' CPU and DSP architectures (VLIW especially). But I also contribute to other aspects like creating tools to help development or testing.

I am also involved in the technical side of customer project proposals (for example, assessing how to best implement OpenCL on a given architecture).

I regularly give compiler-related technical talks and tutorials at developers' meetings such as LLVM and EuroLLVM.

In my free time I love to explore quieter places in Scotland, on a bike or with a backpack. I am also interested in digital music and electronics.
