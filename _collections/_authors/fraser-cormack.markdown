Fraser joined Codeplay in 2012 and develops compilers for GPUs and other novel architectures.

You may recognise him from the popular tutorials he and Pierre gave on building LLVM backends.

He takes pride in his second job as the office's resident vim consultant.

In his spare time, he enjoys brewing his own beer and listening to "math rock", whatever that is.
