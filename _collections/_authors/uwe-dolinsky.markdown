With Codeplay since the early beginnings. I'm in charge of building and maintaining the company's unique core IP which enables customers to benefit from our long experience delivering tools targeting a wide range of very specialized low-energy heterogeneous processors. Some of this work is patented and concentrates on new non-standard technologies to enable the efficient implementation of standards such as C++ and SYCL in Codeplay's products. This includes solving portability and performance issues currently not addressed in mainstream compilers.

I lead or was involved in many different projects at Codeplay ranging from research to delivering and supporting production tools for various processors e.g. PhysX and several other VLIW platforms. Some of the current technical focusses are on:

Enhancing Codeplay's compiler technology and integrating parts of it into ComputeCPP (Codeplay's SYCL implementation).

Delivering and integrating highly optimising compilers for low-energy platforms.

Static analysis and advanced diagnostics especially targeting problems occurring on specialized heterogeneous platforms.

Building conformance/performance evaluation systems to enable regression testing for rapid and continuous delivery.
