<p><b>SYCL Summer Sessions 2021</b></p>
<p><b>Michel Migdal, Codeplay Software and ENSIIE</b></p>
<p>The DPC++ compatibility tool does a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to porting your code from CUDA to SYCL and there are also guides to help you understand and compare these programming models. In this talk I will help you to understand how to use some techniques to get the best performance out of your ported SYCL code.</p>
