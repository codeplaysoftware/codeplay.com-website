<p>CppCon is the annual, week-long face-to-face gathering for the entire C++ community. The conference is organized by the C++ community for the community. You will enjoy inspirational talks and a friendly atmosphere designed to help attendees learn from each other, meet interesting people, and generally have a stimulating experience. Taking place this year in the beautiful Seattle neighborhood of Bellevue and including multiple diverse tracks, the conference will appeal to anyone from C++ novices to experts.</p>
<p><strong><u>What you can expect at CppCon:</u></strong></p>
<p><ul><li><span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;"><strong><u>Invited talks and panels: </u></strong>the CppCon keynote by Bjarne Stroustrup will start off a week full of insight from some of the world’s leading experts in C++. Still have questions? Ask them at one of CppCon’s panels featuring those at the cutting edge of the language.</span><br></li><li><span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;"><strong><u>Presentations by the C++ community:</u></strong> What do embedded systems, game development, high frequency trading, and particle accelerators have in common? C++, of course! Expect talks from a broad range of domains focused on practical C++ techniques, libraries, and tools.</span><br></li><li><span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;"><strong><u>Lightning talks: </u></strong>Get informed at a fast pace during special sessions of short, less formal talks. Never presented at a conference before? This is your chance to share your thoughts on a C++-related topic in an informal setting.</span><br></li><li><span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;">Evening events and “unconference” time: Relax, socialize, or start an impromptu coding session.</span><br></li></ul></p>
<p>CppCon’s goal is to encourage the best use of C++ while preserving the diversity of viewpoints and experiences, but other than that it is non-partisan and has no agenda. The conference is a project of the Standard C++ Foundation, a not-for-profit organization whose purpose is to support the C++ software developer community and promote the understanding and use of modern, standard C++ on all compilers and platforms. <strong><u>More information can be found here -<a href="https://cppcon.org/about/">CppCon</a></u></strong></p>
