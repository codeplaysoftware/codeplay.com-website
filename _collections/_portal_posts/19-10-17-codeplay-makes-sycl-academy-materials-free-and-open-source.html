    <a href="https://sycl.tech">SYCL™</a> is an open standard developed by the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/">Khronos™ Group</a> that enables developers to write code for heterogeneous systems using standard C++.  Developers are looking at how they can accelerate their applications without having to write optimized processor specific code. SYCL is the industry standard for C++ acceleration, giving developers a platform to write high-performance code in standard C++, unlocking the performance of accelerators and specialized processors from companies such as AMD™, Intel™, Renesas™, and Arm®.</span>
</p>

<p>Codeplay Software, developers of <a href="https://developer.codeplay.com">ComputeCpp,</a> the world's first SYCL v1.2.1 conformant implementation, has today announced the release of a set of SYCL educational materials as part of an open source initiative. The project, named SYCL Academy, makes the same materials used for professional training courses at CppCon and IWOCL available for free use.</p>

<p>Adoption of the SYCL standard is increasing rapidly, with a growing number of companies using the standard with their latest processors including <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intels-one-api-project-delivers-unified-programming-model-across-diverse-architectures/#gs.ai61ez">Intel's oneAPI project</a> and <a href="https://www.imgtec.com/blog/separating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-in-embedded-ai/">Imagination's PowerVR</a>, and many software developers are already using SYCL to accelerate their applications with multi core processors such as GPUs. In turn, this growing interest in using SYCL to accelerate all types of software requires developers who understand how to develop applications that can offload work to multi-core processors. While there are already a broad range of guides, articles, and documentation available, the SYCL Academy materials make it possible for anyone to teach a set of modules. In particular, schools and universities can teach students how to program parallel hardware using standard C++ code and an open standard with transferable skills and techniques.</p>

<p>There is an article explaining all about the open source project <a href="https://www.codeplay.com/portal/10-16-19-presenting-sycl-academy"><a href="https://www.codeplay.com/portal/10-17-19-making-it-easier-to-teach-and-learn-sycl">on the Codeplay blog</a></a>.</p>

<p>Rod Burns, Developer Relations Manager at Codeplay Software, says, "These materials make it possible to teach SYCL at schools, universities, and even within businesses, it reduces the barrier to entry for developers wanting to adopt parallel programming in C++. This is just the beginning for this project, we plan to continue to expand it with the help of the rest of the SYCL community."</p>

<p>
  <span>Michael Wong, SYCL Working Group Chair at Khronos</span>
  <span>, says, “We’re very proud to be able to share an open source set of learning materials for SYCL. The standard has been experiencing dramatic growth, and we believe that the best way to continue helping developers to </span>
  <span>write high-performance code in standard C++ is to give them a platform to facilitate education and knowledge-sharing.”</span>
