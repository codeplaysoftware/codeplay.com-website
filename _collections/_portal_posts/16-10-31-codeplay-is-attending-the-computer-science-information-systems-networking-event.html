<p>On Wednesday 2nd November 2016, Codeplay will be attending the specially organised Career Fair at Heriot-Watt University. You will be able to locate Codeplay in the Cedar Suite, Hugh Nisbet Building from 14.30pm - 16.30pm.</p>
<p><em>'This event has been specifically organised for Computer Science and Information Systems students to raise the level of awareness about the opportunities available within the industry and give an insight into different career areas. It also provides the opportunity to network with potential employers and / or placement providers, as we will put attendees into small groups to take part in "speed networking" with the providers.
