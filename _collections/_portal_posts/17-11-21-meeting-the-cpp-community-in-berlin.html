<p>Simon Brand, Senior Software Engineer at Codeplay, travelled to Berlin for the <a href="http://meetingcpp.com/">Meeting C++ conference</a> on 9-11 November and has shared his thoughts <a href="http://www.aerialmantis.co.uk/blog/2017/11/09/cppcon-2017-trip-report/"><a href="https://blog.tartanllama.xyz/meetingcpp-2017/">on his blog</a></a>.</p>With over 600 attendees, Meeting C++ is the largest C++ conference in Europe, and comes hot on the heels of CppCon - the largest C++ conference in North America that <a href="https://www.codeplay.com/portal/11-09-17-learning-and-teaching-at-cppcon-17">Gordon wrote about earlier this month</a>.<br>
<p>Simon was privileged to have the opportunity to do his "<a href="http://meetingcpp.com/2017/talks/items/How_Cpp_Debuggers_Work.html">How C++ Debuggers Work</a>" talk on the main track, but that was not his only reason for attending. Going to a conference, as Simon reinforces, is an excellent opportunity to meet other like minded people and also talk to some of the world's experts in C++ programming in person. In Simon's case it was the opportunity to put a face to a name after long conversations online, and as a company it is important that we are at the forefront of the C++ community.</p>The blog includes some short reports on the wide range of sessions that Simon attended when he was there, so if you didn't make it this year perhaps this will help persuade you to go along for next years Meeting C++<br><br>
