Codeplay Software Limited today announced its new contributor member status with the <strong>Khronos Group</strong>, an industry consortium focused on the creation of open-standard, royalty-free APIs for embedded systems. As a contributing member of the Khronos Group, Codeplay will be an active player in the development of OpenGL ES 2.X shader compiler technology, which will bring cross-platform accelerated 3D and 2D graphics applications to embedded platforms. Codeplay will accelerate the delivery of cutting-edge embedded graphics compilers to its customers through early access to OpenGL ES specification drafts and conformance tests.
