<p><b>Codeplay’s&nbsp;Acoran&nbsp;Software Platform&nbsp;adds support for&nbsp;AndesCore™ NX27V&nbsp;<br></b></p><p><b>San Francisco, California</b> – December&nbsp;6,&nbsp;2021&nbsp;–&nbsp;Codeplay&nbsp;Software®, the&nbsp;industry leader and pioneer in&nbsp;Open-Standard software tools and services for&nbsp;artificial intelligence, machine-learning,&nbsp;and&nbsp;high-performance computing&nbsp;announced&nbsp;support for&nbsp;Andes Technology Corporation’s&nbsp;AndesCore™ NX27V&nbsp;IP.&nbsp; Andes Technology is a&nbsp;leader in high-performance / low-power IP and a founding&nbsp;premier&nbsp;member of RISC-V International.&nbsp; The NX27V is an RV64GC&nbsp;vector&nbsp;processor&nbsp;supporting&nbsp;the RISC-V&nbsp;Vector&nbsp;&nbsp;specification&nbsp;with up to 512-bit VLEN and SIMD width (or DLEN). It&nbsp;allows&nbsp;SoC&nbsp;designers to create&nbsp;next-generation&nbsp;compute-acceleration&nbsp;solutions that leverage AI, ML, and HPC&nbsp;in both the edge and the cloud.&nbsp; Initially,&nbsp;Codeplay&nbsp;will deliver&nbsp;support&nbsp;through the&nbsp;AndesCore&nbsp;performance&nbsp;simulator&nbsp;that provides&nbsp;near cycle accurate&nbsp;information.&nbsp;This will enable customers to&nbsp;implement a software-first strategy and&nbsp;then&nbsp;move to&nbsp;specific SoC architecture based on&nbsp;the NX27V.&nbsp;</p><p>Compute-accelerated&nbsp;solutions&nbsp;need a new programming model to leverage all the capabilities of the processing power available.&nbsp; Incorporating&nbsp;one or more vector&nbsp;processor&nbsp;cores,&nbsp;SoC&nbsp;developers and designers can create applications that leverage a Single-Instruction / Multi&nbsp;Data&nbsp;&nbsp;(SIMD)&nbsp;heterogeneous&nbsp;architecture.&nbsp; Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning applications&nbsp;are&nbsp;required to process&nbsp;a significant amount of&nbsp;vector&nbsp;data&nbsp;for&nbsp;applications like&nbsp;neural networks and computer-vision&nbsp;algorithms&nbsp;seen in&nbsp;cloud&nbsp;acceleration cards,&nbsp;autonomous vehicles and visual recognition.&nbsp;A powerful vector processor&nbsp;like the NX27V&nbsp;can&nbsp;rapidly increase the&nbsp;performance of&nbsp;processing this data.&nbsp;</p><p>Codeplay's&nbsp;Acoran&nbsp;software&nbsp;platform support for&nbsp;NX27V-based&nbsp;simulator and then&nbsp;SoC&nbsp;will provide a wide ecosystem of domain-specific optimized libraries for&nbsp;exascale&nbsp;and artificial intelligence. A key foundation of Acoran is&nbsp;SYCL, an open standard programming model that enables heterogeneous programming based on standard ISO C++.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“The NX27V&nbsp;has been adopted by&nbsp;about 10 customer SoC projects for the&nbsp;datacenter&nbsp;accelerators. All incorporate multiple instances of&nbsp;our&nbsp;vector processor in cluster-based heterogenous architecture,” said Dr.&nbsp;Charlie&nbsp;Su, President and CTO&nbsp;at Andes Technology.&nbsp;“The&nbsp;exciting&nbsp;partnership&nbsp;with&nbsp;Codeplay&nbsp;enables&nbsp;us to&nbsp;bring elegant programming solutions to our customers.&nbsp; We are at the beginning of the next wave&nbsp;SoCs with Domain-Specific Architecture&nbsp;(DSA)&nbsp;for applications&nbsp;ranging from&nbsp;embedded devices&nbsp;to&nbsp;datacenter&nbsp;accelerators&nbsp;that support AI and HPC.&nbsp; The growth potential in this area is enormous.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Codeplay&nbsp;is embracing the software-first approach to designing&nbsp;complex&nbsp;compute&nbsp;systems,” said Andrew Richards, CEO and founder of&nbsp;Codeplay&nbsp;Software. “This partnership with Andes will&nbsp;bring developers of RISC-V vector SoCs the opportunity to optimize their architecture based on real application software.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Collaboration is at the heart of the RISC-V ecosystem, so&nbsp;it’s great to see members join forces to develop innovative new&nbsp;approaches&nbsp;for the benefit of the entire community,”&nbsp;said Calista&nbsp;Redmond,&nbsp;CEO of RISC-V International.&nbsp; “Together,&nbsp;Andes Technology and&nbsp;Codeplay&nbsp;Software&nbsp;are&nbsp;offering&nbsp;a solution to&nbsp;allow&nbsp;developers and designers&nbsp;to&nbsp;leverage&nbsp;the best of open standards for hardware and software.”&nbsp;</p><p>“SYCL&nbsp;has&nbsp;been&nbsp;adopted by&nbsp;organizations building&nbsp;large&nbsp;supercomputers&nbsp;with a variety of GPU architectures. This&nbsp;partnership&nbsp;will help to bring&nbsp;open standard programming to&nbsp;the&nbsp;next generation of specialist processors implementing the RISC-V ISA, which is very exciting for hardware and software developers,” said Michael Wong, Chair of SYCL&nbsp;Working Group&nbsp;within&nbsp;The Khronos Group,&nbsp;Chair of&nbsp;Datacenter / Cloud Computing SIG with RISC-V&nbsp;International,&nbsp;and Distinguished Engineer at&nbsp;Codeplay&nbsp;Software.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Codeplay&nbsp;and Andes welcome&nbsp;companies looking to embrace&nbsp;RVV for accelerating their AI systems&nbsp;to evaluate the&nbsp;solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>About Andes Technology&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Sixteen years in business and a Founding Premier member of RISC-V International, Andes is a leading supplier of high-performance/low-power 32/64-bit embedded processor IP solutions, and a main force to take RISC-V mainstream. Andes’ fifth-generation&nbsp;AndeStar™ architecture adopted the RISC-V as the base. Its V5 RISC-V CPU families range from tiny 32-bit cores to advanced 64-bit cores with DSP, FPU, Vector, Linux, superscalar, and/or multicore capabilities. The annual volume of Andes-Embedded SoCs has exceeded 2 billion since 2020 and continues to rise.&nbsp;At the end of Q3 2021, the cumulative volume of Andes-Embedded™ SoCs has reached&nbsp;9&nbsp;billion.
