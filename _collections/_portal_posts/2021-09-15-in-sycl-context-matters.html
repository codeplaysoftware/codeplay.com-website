<p>In SYCL, contexts are used for memory isolation. This is a common source of error, mainly when using SYCL2020 Unified Shared Memory. In particular, a kernel submitted to a queue (Q1 for example) can only access memory that has been allocated in the same context as the one used to create Q1.</p>
<p>This 30min talk will illustrate those contexts subtleties via small reproducers extracted from real-life examples and provide recommendations on how one can avoid those pitfalls.</p>
