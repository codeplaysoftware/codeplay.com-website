<p>Codeplay is pleased to announce that our engineers will be attending the <a href="http://www.ieee-hpec.org/">2014 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing</a> (HPEC) conference.
</p>
<p>
HPEC is the largest computing conference in New England and is the premier conference in the world on the convergence of High Performance and Embedded Computing. It is a great opportunity for meeting up with, and learning from, those interested in computing hardware, software, systems, and applications where performance matters.
</p>
<p>
Our R&amp;D Product Development Lead, Maria Rovatsou, will be presenting a talk on SYCL™: A System which integrates C++ with OpenCL™.
