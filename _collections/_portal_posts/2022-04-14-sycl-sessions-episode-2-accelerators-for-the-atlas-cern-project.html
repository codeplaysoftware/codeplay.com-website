<p>In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYPGtTUBSF4">latest episode of SYCL Sessions</a>, I was joined by
co-host Dr Tom Deakin and Dr Attila Krasznahorkay who is helping to lead the
efforts at CERN on the ATLAS experiment.</p>
<p>The ATLAS experiment is the largest, general purpose
particle detector experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and is helping
to advance physics to make new discoveries, for example the Higgs boson. The
experiment includes a huge code base involving both the processing of data from
the detector but also many simulations that are used to examine this data too.</p>
<p>A large challenge for this experiment's team is that the
sheer volume of information is increasing and new techniques are required to
process it in an acceptable timeframe. Attila presents the challenges they are
facing and how they are exploring ways to solve that using SYCL to target GPUs
from a range of vendors.<br></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="{{ '/assets/images/portal/article-images/sessoions2play.png' | relative_url }}" width="469" height="263"></div><div><br></div>
<p>Tom and I also had a short chat with Attila about the
presentation and some of the large challenges faced when migrating large code
bases to run on accelerator processors such as GPUs.</p>
<p>Alongside that I talked with Tom about the upcoming schedule
at IWOCL and SYCLcon where there are a record 22 SYCL talks scheduled on the
program, and discussed some other activities happening in the SYCL community.</p>
