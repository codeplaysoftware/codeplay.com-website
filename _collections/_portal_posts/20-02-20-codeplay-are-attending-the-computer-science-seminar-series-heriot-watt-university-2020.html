<p>Duncan McBain, Staff Software Engineer, will be providing an abstract on developing parallel applications with SYCL™, an open standards alternative to CUDA, at Heriot Watt University on the 27th February from 4.15pm to 5.15pm.</p>

<p>Computer system architecture trends are constantly evolving to provide higher performance and computing power, to support the increasing demand for high-performance computing domains including AI, machine learning, image processing and automotive driving aids.</p>

<p>Duncan's talk will introduce application development using the SYCL programming model. SYCL allows users to write standard C++ code which is then executed on a range of heterogeneous architectures including CPUs, GPUs, DSPs, FPGAs and other accelerators. On top of this SYCL also provides a high-level abstraction which allows users to describe their computations as a task graph with data dependencies, while the SYCL runtime performs data dependency analysis and scheduling. SYCL also supports a host device which will execute on the host CPU with the same execution and memory model guarantees as OpenCL for debugging purposes, and a fallback mechanism which allows an application to recover from failure.</p>
