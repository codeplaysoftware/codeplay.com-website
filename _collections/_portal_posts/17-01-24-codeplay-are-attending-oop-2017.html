<p>Codeplay will be attending the annual OOP conference which will be held on the 30th January - 3rd February at the International Congress Centre, Munich (ICM). Attending from Codeplay will be <strong><u>Michael Wong</u></strong>, VP of Research &amp; Development. We are always delighted to speak with anyone attending the event who is interested in what we are doing, so if you are attending, please come and say <strong><em>“hello”</em></strong>. If you are interested and would like to arrange a meeting with us at the event, please use our <a href="https://www.codeplay.com/support/contact/"><strong><u>contact form</u></strong></a> or follow us on @codeplaysoft and make contact!</p>
<p>Michael Wong will be holding a session and giving a talk on Wednesday 1st February - 17.00pm: <strong><em>"Parallel and Concurrent Programming in C++17 and Beyond".</em></strong><em> "C++11/14 has already changed how we do parallel programming with facilities for advanced threads, memory model, asynch, and futures. C++17 and beyond promises many more concurrent feature items. As editor of the Concurrency and Transactional Memory Technical Specification as well as Chair of C++ SG5 and SG14, I will show how parallel algorithms is done in C++17 and beyond in C++20. Abstract - For C++20, we will have data-based parallelism (simd), task-based parallelism (task blocks), execution agents, progress guarantees, futures ++ such as then, wait_any, wait_all, executors, resumable functions, lock free programming, synchronics, atomic views, coroutines, transactional memory, latches, barrier, and ultimately heterogeneous computing with massive parallel dispatch. These promise to elevate C++ into a language that supports all the MIPS in your system, end to end".</em></p>
<p>"OOP is the meeting point for people who work primarily in the enterprise environment. Technical experts (architects, developers, business analysts, and testers), technical (project) managers and leaders gain an excellent view on the state-of-the-art in modern software engineering. The program offers many highlights: There are excellent and inspiring keynotes – Marie Moe takes us on a journey into her inner self by sharing her hacker experience with her pacemaker, KarlheinzBrandenburg, co-creator of MP3 gives us an eye-opener for the construction of immersive sounds, Rebecca Wirfs-Brock, the grande dame of object-oriented and agile software development examines what agile software development needs from architects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some known and many new tracks are concerned with the essence of modern software development. In each and every track you can find extraordinary goodies, for example:</p>
<p>• all about microservices – if by focusing on modernizing the architecture, testability, or technology</p>
<p>• new organizational or rather management models like sociocracy, holacracy, or management 3.0</p>
<p>• new insights in bitcoin technology or graphical databases using the panama papers as an example</p>
<p>• tips for programming languages of the next generation like Dart, Go, R, Type-Script, Kotlin, or Clojure</p>
<p>• news from telepresence robotics</p>
<p>Corporations like Allianz, BMW, Cisco, Daimler, Datev, E-Post, Ericsson, Galeria Kaufhof, Rewe or Zalando report on their experiences i.e. about scaling architecture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Top-class speakers like <strong>Michael Wong, Steve Freeman, Gunter Dueck, Aino Corry, Yves Hanoulle with Clare Sudbery, or Gernot Starke</strong> share their new insights. Moreover, Frank Buschmann invited to the track Details Matter diverse experts, who will dive into the details. For example Simon Brown, who shows how coding styles can help describe architecture, Allen Wirfs-Brock, who presents how JavaScript has been transformed into a better language, or Dave Farley, one of the thought leaders in Continuous Delivery, who explains how continuous delivery changes the economics of software development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Also this year we want to emphasize the interaction and networking amongst all participants. Poker, Tabletop football, or the substantial exhibition together with the OpenLounge, encourage sharing experiences and thoughts with others by providing a perfect platform for doing so". <strong><u><a href="http://www.oop-konferenz.de/oop2017.html">More on the conference can be found here: OOP 2017</a></u></strong></p>
<p>Codeplay is also proud to announce the new release of ComputeCpp CE, enabling, <a href="https://www.codeplay.com/portal/earlyaccesstothesyclopenstandardforcacceleration"><strong><u>Early Access to the SYCL Open Standard for C++ Acceleration</u></strong></a></p><br>
