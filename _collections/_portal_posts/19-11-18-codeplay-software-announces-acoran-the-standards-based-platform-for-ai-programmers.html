<p>The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is stimulating the development of new processor and accelerator hardware designs, while software frameworks are adapting to keep pace with the latest machine learning techniques. In order to take advantage of this AI revolution, processor companies need to build compatible solutions for software developers that integrate with existing software frameworks and technologies.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.codeplay.com/products/acoran/">Codeplay's Acoran</a><strong></strong> provides all the performance and programmability solutions that developers need to target accelerated processors, delivering a software platform that accelerates a range of AI software on a wide range of hardware platforms using industry standards.</p>

<p>Since 2002, Codeplay has been involved in the definition of industry open standards and developed many solutions using them, gaining a reputation as a leader in enabling the latest processors. These open standards are used in <strong>Acoran </strong>to enable the latest AI software and make full use of the performance of the latest accelerated processors.</p>

<p>Codeplay has developed the <strong>Acoran </strong>platform based on the most relevant and preferred standards, with a comprehensive set of libraries that give AI developers an assured feature set for their applications. With strong momentum in Khronos standards in the industry, SYCL, OpenCL and Vulkan are at the core of the platform, with further support that includes these open source projects:</p>

<p>Codeplay is already working extensively with processor companies and is capable of delivering the <strong>Acoran </strong>platform for processors supplied by, but not limited to, Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Renesas, Arm and Imagination Technologies.</p>

<p>“The AI industry is advancing at such a pace that companies are evolving products without aligning their software strategy, resulting in many proprietary implementations and confusion for AI software developers.” said Andrew Richards, founder and CEO of Codeplay. “Our existing products are already helping to define and align the AI industry, and the <strong>Acoran </strong>platform takes this one step further to help the industry evolve faster.”</p>

<p>Codeplay will be presenting and discussing <strong>Acoran</strong>, and its benefits at <a href="https://sc19.supercomputing.org/">SuperComputing in Denver from 17<sup>th</sup> -  22<sup>nd</sup> Nov</a>.</p>
