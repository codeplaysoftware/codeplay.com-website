<p>Codeplay has succesfully tested programs written using the <a href="en/products/sieve-multicore-programming-system">Sieve Parallel Processing System</a> on a dual Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; 5300 system. The results showed 740% performance increase executing in parallel on 8 cores compared to that on a single core.
</p>
<p>
The test programs written in <a href="index.php?Itemid=184">Sieve C</a>, which were originally created to test Sieve on a dual-core system, were run on the 8-Core PC with no changes to the code or re-compilation.  These tests show the Sieve system to be a powerful and easy to use system for writing scalable and portable C/C++ programs which fully exploit all available processing elements.
