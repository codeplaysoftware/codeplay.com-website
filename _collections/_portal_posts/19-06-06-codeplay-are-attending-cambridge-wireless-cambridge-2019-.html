  <strong>Andrew Richards, Founder and CEO, </strong>will be speaking at the<strong> Cambridge Wireless</strong> talk in<strong> Cambridge</strong> on the<strong> 11th June, 2019 </strong>on <strong>Artificial Intelligence is taking over the world and development practices need to catch up</strong>.</p>

<p>Software development techniques in AI have evolved and businesses that can adapt will deliver technologies with incredible new capabilities.
