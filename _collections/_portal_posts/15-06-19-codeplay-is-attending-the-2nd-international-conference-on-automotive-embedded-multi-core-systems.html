<p>Codeplay will be attending the <a href="http://www.multi-core-systems.com">2nd International Conference on Automotive Embedded Multi-Core Systems</a> in Cologne, Germany, 23 – 24 June.
</p>
<p>
The 2nd International Conference on Automotive Embedded Multi-Core Systems is the only event on embedded multi-core technologies for the automotive industry.

<p>
As the automotive industry continues its steady increase in the utilisation of electrical components and functions, so too is it faced with the challenge of requiring increasing amounts of processing power within its embedded systems. After continued increases, the clock rates are stagnating so that single-core processors are no longer adequate to satisfy many of the next generation embedded system requirements. The basis technology for future embedded systems must therefore be multi- and many-core processors.
</p>
<p>
Multi-core processors are superior to their single-core predecessor in calculation power and energy efficiency. However, to apply multi-core processors to systems in the embedded domain software developers, integrators and system architects are faced with various new challenges regarding system complexity and controllability. Furthermore, the new technology has an impact on the whole development process and impacts all development phases alike.
</p>
<p>
IQPC’s Second International Conference “Automotive Embedded Multi-Core Systems” will bring together stakeholders from along the value chain to ensure maximum knowledge transfer and professional exchange. During a full three day programme, you will meet international experts from OEMs, suppliers, and academia to discuss, hear and learn about their experiences and challenges with multi-core design, migration and optimisation.
</p>
<p>
Codeplay Software’s Illya Rudkin, who is leading our ComputeAorta team and their work on ISO 26262 compliance, and Charles MacFarlane, our Product Marketing Consultant, will be attending this event.
</p>
<p>
We’re always delighted to speak with anyone interested in what we’re doing, and will be happy to discuss our ComputeSuite products for automotive, so please come and say “hello”. If you would like to arrange a meeting with us at the event, please follow us on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/codeplaysoft">@codeplaysoft</a> and make contact!
