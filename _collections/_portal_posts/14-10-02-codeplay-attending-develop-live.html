<p>Scotland is home to both some of the world’s biggest and most commercially powerful studios and some of its most innovative, forward-thinking developers, and they now have a global games development event on their doorstep.
</p>
<p>
Two of Codeplay’s finest, Aaron Dron and Luke Iwanski, will be attending <a href="http://www.develop-online.net/events/develop-live/0193364">Develop Live</a> tomorrow in sunny Edinburgh!
</p>
<p>
This is the the first ever Develop Live event taking place in Edinburgh on October 2nd 2014.
</p>
<p>
The one-day conference will comprise a series of lectures and panels covering both international issues and matters close to the Scottish games development sector. If you are attending then please look out for Aaron and Luke (will probably be wearing extremely stylish Codeplay hoodies) and come and say Hello and have a chat with them!</p>
