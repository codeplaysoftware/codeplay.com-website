<p>Codeplay will be attending the  <a href="http://cgo.org/cgo2015/">2015 International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization</a> in San Francisco, from 7 - 11 February.
</p>
<p>
The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO) will bring together researchers and practitioners working at the interface of hardware and software on a wide range of optimization and code generation techniques and related issues. The conferences span the spectrum from purely static to fully dynamic approaches, including techniques ranging from pure software-based methods to architectural features and support.
</p>
<p>
Attending from Codeplay will be Ruyman Reyes and Fraser Cormack. We’re always delighted to speak with anyone interested in what we’re doing, so please come and say &quot;hello&quot;.
