title: Codeplay @ IWOCL 2024

<p>The Windy City of Chicago was host to the 12th iteration of the IWOCL conference in April 2024, gathering members of
    the SYCL and OpenCL communities from very different backgrounds. This conference is the perfect setting for Khronos
    working groups members, implementers and users to share their experience and knowledge, pushing the boundaries of
    what is achievable within these ecosystems.</p>
<p>SYCL itself has always been tightly linked to Codeplay, given its focus in our community as one of the main drivers
    of its development. This way, Codeplay was a proud sponsor of IWOCL 2024 and also put its grain of sand to organize
    the conference as a Khronos member.</p>
<p>The conference started on Monday with the HackFest session chaired by Intel's Sri Ramkrishna and sponsored by Intel
    and Codeplay. This year's HackFest was a great point of contact between users and SYCL experts including HackFest
    mentors Tom Deakin, from University of Bristol and SYCL Working Group Chair; Aksel Alpay, from Heidelberg University
    and creator of AdaptiveCpp; Thomas Applencourt, from Argonne National Laboratory and SYCL Advisory Panel Chair; and
    our own Hugh Delaney. We were glad to see more and more developers using SYCL in their projects and even porting
    their CUDA codebases to SYCL using existing semi-automatic tools. This is the case of <a
            href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/syclomatic-new-cuda-to-sycl-code-migration-tool.html">SYCLomatic</a>,
    whose adoption among developers signifies its viability and the improvements it has gone through in the last twelve
    months. This first session set the tone of collaboration and openness for the rest of the conference. As one of the
    highlights of the day, we were all witnesses of the partial eclipse taking place that day in the Chicago sky.</p>

<p>Tuesday was the Advanced SYCL Tutorial Day, presented by Aksel Alpay, Thomas Applencourt and Abhishek Bagusetty, from
    Argonne National Laboratory, and Codeplay's Hugh Delaney, who also chaired the tutorial. The tutorial covered
    advanced topics such as concurrency using in-order and out-of-order queues; using multiple devices within SYCL;
    using advanced SYCL features such as group algorithms, reduction operators and atomics; optimizing memory access
    patterns for GPUs; as well as using math libraries like <a
            href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html">oneMKL</a> within SYCL.
    Attendees came from a diverse range of backgrounds, with many attendees being familiar with other GPU programming
    APIs such as CUDA or OpenCL. As such they were keen to discuss their experiences in developing SYCL applications.
    There was also plenty of open discussion where presenters of the tutorial, being either SYCL implementers or SYCL
    application developers, advised attendees on how to extract maximum performance from their SYCL applications, or
    resolve any issues they were facing. The SYCL tutorial was followed by a reception in which Khronos provided SYCL
    T-shirts and attendees could share their views and experiences.</p>

<p>The rest of the days of the conference, Wednesday and Thursday, were allocated for conference sessions. The first
    three slots were reserved for keynotes, in which OpenCL, SYCL and SYCL SC working groups could give the community an
    update on their progress throughout the year and what is to come. On the SYCL side, Tom Deakin shared ongoing plans
    for <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-add-sycl-programming-model-support">SYCL upstreaming to LLVM</a>, gave
    an update on <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/dpc-compiler.html">Intel's
        DPC++</a> as the first SYCL 2020-conformant implementation and hinted an upcoming SYCL version codenamed SYCL
    Next. Marking the anniversary of the SYCL SC announcement, Codeplay's Hugh Delaney and Víctor Pérez presented the
    ongoing efforts in the specification of a new Khronos standard for safety critical systems based on SYCL, which will
    enable heterogeneous computing on safety critical industries such as automotive or medical.</p>
<p>Among all of the many interesting talks, I would personally like to highlight a few of them:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3648115.3648130">Evaluation of SYCL's Different Data Parallel
        Kernels</a>, Marcel Breyer from University of Stuttgart, taking home the Outstanding Short Paper or Technical
        Talk Award and discussing performance differences when using different APIs for submitting kernels on DPC++ and
        AdaptiveCpp.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3648115.3648117">AdaptiveCpp Stdpar: C++ Standard Parallelism Integrated

<p>As usual, the IWOCL poster session lead to interesting discussion. Several posters told user stories on porting CUDA
    codebases to SYCL using SYCLomatic, such as <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3648115.3648122">Lessons Learned

    and CERN, obtaining the Outstanding Poster Award. Codeplayers Victor Perez and Hugh Delaney also presented in-house
    developments on new SYCL features available as DPC++ extensions, bringing improvements to runtime instantiation of
    SYCL kernels via the new <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3648115.3648126">private_alloca API</a>, and <a
            href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3648115.3648637">extensions to the SYCL 2020 host_task</a> feature.

<p>After this great experience in IWOCL, we can only thank once more the organizers for their great work bringing SYCL
    people together once again and making our time in the city as easy as possible.<br/></p>
