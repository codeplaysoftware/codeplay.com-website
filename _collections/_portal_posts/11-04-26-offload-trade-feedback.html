<p>It has been a few weeks now since the release of our Offload 2.0&trade; technology, complete with the redesigned website and a full blown knowledge base to help developers use our technology. Also with the announcement of our involvement in 'NASCAR, The Game 2011', it has been a good few weeks for us here at Codeplay.
</p>


<p>
We have had some good feedback from developers so far about the release, but we are always eager to listen and act on suggestions from our users. At Codeplay we really want to make it easy to program for the SPU, as easy as it always should have been!
</p>


<p>
If you have any suggestions, questions, queries or ideas regarding our technology, please don't hesitate to drop me a line neil<img class="email-at-symbol" src="{{ '/assets/images/global/at-symbol.svg' | relative_url }}" />codeplay.com.

Many thanks,Neil Henning (Technology Lead @ Codeplay).
