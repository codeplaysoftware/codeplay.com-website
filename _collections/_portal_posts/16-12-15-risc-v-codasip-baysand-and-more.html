<p><span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: inherit;">Recently the RISC-V Fifth Workshop took place at Google in Mountain View. As always, there were lots of presentations from academics. RISC-V has been a big hit there as the only instruction set architecture that is feasible for use in teaching and research, others being either too complicated or involving too many lawyers, or both.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: inherit;">But for me the most interesting aspect of the workshop are the companies producing silicon and providing routes to silicon. If RISC-V is going to be more than an academic curiosity, which I firmly believe, then it needs to have commercial chips and it needs to have systems built around them. I already talked about SiFive in RISC-V Available in Silicon. Another player is Codasip and their partners.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: inherit;">CodePlay provides support for a layered programming model from graph-based programming, normal C/C++, down to assembly language and VHDL. There is a focus on machine learning and vision, which will be important in many applications.&nbsp;</span></p>
