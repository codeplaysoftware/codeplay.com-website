<p><b>At Intel Vision 2022, Codeplay Demonstrates Strategies
  for Migrating Software Assets from Proprietary CUDA to Open Standards and
  multi-platform SYCL and oneAPI</b> <br></p><p>Using automated tools,
  open-source software, the SYCL programming model and oneAPI to enable multiple processor targets
  were topics covered by Codeplay experts at <a
      href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/events/on-event-series/vision.html">Intel Vision 2022</a>. This
  includes accelerator processor targets
  from Nvidia, Intel, and beyond. The two-day event was hosted live May 10-11
  outside Dallas, TX, and virtually to a global online audience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In a <a href="https://bcove.video/39iip8P">recorded presentation</a>, the Codeplay team explains
  how to future-proof software development strategies for high performance
  computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) in systems ranging from data
  center and automotive to healthcare and FinTech, by migrating code from the
  proprietary constraints of CUDA to SYCL, an open-standard alternative, embraced
  by multiple hardware vendors. At present, a majority of HPC and AI solutions
  are bound to Nvidia via CUDA, working only with Nvidia chipsets.</p>

<div><p>A key mechanism to
  help accomplish the SYCL migration is the Intel® DPC++ Compatibility Tool
  (Intel® DPCT), which can automatically translate up to 90 percent of the CUDA code;
  the remainder is then analyzed and modified manually.</p>
  <p><b>Avoiding ‘vendor lock’ for a Flexible
    Future</b></p>
  The Codeplay demo shows the
  simplicity of migrating CUDA code to SYCL while continuing to run on Nvidia
  GPUs. By adopting SYCL and oneAPI, users will enjoy a royalty-free, open
  standard alternative to CUDA that’s defined and supported by industry experts
  on a growing range of processors, including Intel, Nvidia, and AMD. <br></div>

<div>For
  example, the National Laboratories for the US Department of Energy chose SYCL
  to enable researchers to target all their supercomputers that include
  processors from different vendors. Researchers realized that their hardware
  changed on average every seven to 10 years, while their software changed every 25
  to 30 years. They wanted to create a software investment that could be
  preserved and expanded as hardware evolved. In response to this need, Codeplay
  is partnering with Argonne, Oak Ridge, and Lawrence Berkeley National
  Laboratories to enable SYCL on the Perlmutter, Polaris and Frontier
  supercomputers by extending support in the open source DPC++ compiler project. <br></div>

<div><p><b>Industry Momentum</b></p>
  Moving to open standards
  software offers organizations improved portability and performance, and
  perhaps, more importantly, choice through access to a broad ecosystem. &nbsp;Made up of industry leaders, this
  extensive
  ecosystem offers familiar development tools, verified libraries and frameworks,
  along with benchmarks.
