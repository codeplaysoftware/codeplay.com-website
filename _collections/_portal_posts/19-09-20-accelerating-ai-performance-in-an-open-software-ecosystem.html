<p>In the <a href="http://bit.ly/accelerating-ai">latest White Paper</a> from the Linley Group, Linley Gwennap examines how an open software ecosystem is critical to enable developers to write artificial intelligence software that takes full advantage of the latest processors.<br></p>
<p>Gwennap says "Customers need more than just fast hardware; they need to run many different types of networks. Furthermore, customers want to evolve their algorithms and even create new types of models in the future."</p>
<p>"Nvidia's software stack, based on its proprietary CUDA, creates a high barrier to entry for challengers. SYCL, the only open alternative to CUDA that has multivendor support, enables customers to move to higher performance hardware while retaining software flexibility. A commercial version of SYCL, branded ComputeCpp, is offered by Codeplay."</p>
