<p><b>Andrew Richards, CEO of Codeplay&reg; Software</b>, will present on 14th February at the Multicore World
    conference in Wellington, New Zealand, romantically describing his journey from the earliest software
    challenges in the 90’s to the next generation of complex heterogeneous computers with the latest
    high-performance accelerators.</p>

<p>Andrew sets out the challenges highlighting software advantages and disadvantages through this career,
    but clearly concludes that an open standards based ecosystem with industry-wide definition and adoption
    is by far the best solution for the next generation of systems. Open source is also critical to ensure
    widespread development and extensive adoption into products.</p>

<p>oneAPI is an open source ecosystem that implements the Khronos open standard SYCL&trade; and includes libraries
    for enabling AI and HPC applications with platform independence. oneAPI is already extensively embraced
    by many companies including numerous US National Labs supercomputers, and as momentum gathers other
    companies and industries are following suit.</p>
