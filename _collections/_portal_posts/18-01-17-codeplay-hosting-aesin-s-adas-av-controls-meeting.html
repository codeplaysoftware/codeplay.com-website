<p>The automotive industry is rapidly moving towards increased levels of automation, and in order to make this possible,
  Codeplay are working to bring open standard based frameworks to automotive Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).
  By engaging with a range of groups our team can provide valuable input to the industry, and also learn from the
  industry as a whole. One of the groups that Codeplay is engaging with is the <a href="https://aesin.org.uk/">Automotive
    Electronic Systems Innovation Network</a> (AESIN).<br><br>As part of TechWorks, AESIN is a dedicated UK initiative
  focused on the accelerated and advanced delivery of Electronic Systems into vehicles and infrastructure operated by
  the UK Trade Association. It is a network for everyone in the automotive supply chain to progress the Automotive
  Electronics Industry in the UK to discuss and importantly to facilitate world-beating innovation by enabling
  collaboration, sharing of expert knowledge and best practice in a non-competitive and effective environment. <br><br>Jaguar
  Land Rover’s Purchasing Risk Manager Michael Mychajluk is quoted on <a
      href="https://aesin.org.uk/about/about-automotive-electronics/">AESIN’s website</a> as saying “the car of tomorrow
  will make increasing use of sophisticated, highly integrated electronic systems for safety, comfort and performance.
  There are many exciting areas of development enabled by electronic systems but this introduces a significant
  complexity issue which can only be addressed by a supply chain that works more effectively together. This presents us
  all with a once in a generation opportunity to streamline the process and accelerate innovation from R&amp;D to
  on-the-road production vehicles.” <br></p><p align="center"><img

    partnership with Renesas</a> and participation in various AESIN activities, including a presentation at AESIN's ADAS
  &amp; AV seminar at Warwick University in front of a large audience. During the seminar in December, Codeplay's
  Safety-Critical Software Development Lead Illya Rudkin presented on "Open Standards for ADAS Vision and Machine
  Learning." This presentation outlined how Advanced Driver Assistance Systems can be developed to meet the levels of
  automation set out by SAE, and how open standards will help to achieve this faster.</p>

  The members of AESIN come from a broad set of disciplines across the Automotive Electronics supply chain that includes
  OEMs, Tier 1 and Tier 2 component makers, and system software developers. Unsurprisingly there are numerous areas for
  development in vehicles and the infrastructure systems to support them, so AESIN have five working groups. Codeplay
  joined the ADAS and AV Control group to facilitate and promote the advantages of using Khronos open standards in
  complex software stacks such as those used to implement vision analysis and machine learning. This particular
  "Control" group has around 60 members spread across other sub-control groups.<br><br>OEMs and Tier 1 automotive
  companies are beginning to realize that there are opportunities and solutions outside their existing domain and
  Codeplay is being recognized for the expertise and solutions we can provide by participating within AESIN. If you
  would like to participate alongside Codeplay with AESIN you can find out the events they host and how to get involved
  on the <a href="https://aesin.org.uk/membership/benefits/">AESIN website</a>.<br></p>
