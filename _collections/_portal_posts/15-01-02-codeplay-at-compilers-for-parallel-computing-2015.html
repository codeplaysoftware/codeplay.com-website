<p>Codeplay will be attending the the 18th International Workshop on <a href="http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/plas/event/cpc15/">Compilers for Parallel Computing</a> (CPC 2015), organized by the Department of Computing at Imperial College London.
</p>
<p>
CPC 2015 is a workshop with no published proceedings.  Instead, it’s a meeting of international research specialists, to present research and exchange ideas. The main goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers in compilation and associated areas, in an informal and relaxed atmosphere in order to exchange ideas and to foster collaboration. The scope encompasses all areas of parallelism and optimization, from embedded systems to large scale parallel systems and computational grids.
</p>
<p>
Attending from Codeplay will be Fraser Cormack. We’re always delighted to speak with anyone interested in what we’re doing, so please come and say “hello”. If you would like to arrange a meeting with us at the event, please follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/codeplaybiz">@codeplaybiz</a> and make contact!
