In fact, back in February Michael Wong, Distinguished Engineer at Codeplay, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_KRwkxLfHc">presented at the Toronto LLVM Developer Meetup</a> on the latest ISO C++ updates. We also presented in 2018 on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y3-pV_b-1U">The Future Direction of C++,</a> 2016 on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKX6EMEib4g">C++ on Accelerators: Supporting Single-Source SYCL and HSA Programming Models Using Clang</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBC61L0QKCM">Bringing RenderScript to LLDB</a>, and in 2015 on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePu6c4FLc9I">Creating an SPMD Vectorizer for OpenCL with LLVM</a>.</p><p>This year Alexander Johnston, one of our engineers, is doing a talk entitled <a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2020-09/speakers/">SYCL™ for CUDA™: An overview of implementing PI for CUDA</a> on the 7th October at 12pm. He will talk through Codeplay's contribution to Intel's open source SYCL implementation, based on LLVM, that uses an abstraction layer to dispatch SYCL commands to different backends including OpenCL and CUDA. This talk gives an overview of the steps involved in the development of the CUDA backend, from Clang modifications down to CUDA calls.</p><p>The LLVM Developers' Meeting is a bi-annual gathering of the entire LLVM Project community and runs from the 6th to the 8th October. This year is the first virtual event!</p><p>The conference is organized by the LLVM Foundation and many volunteers within the LLVM community.
