<p style="text-align: center;"><b>oneAPI Construction Kit Joins the Unified Acceleration Foundation</b></p>
<p>The oneAPI Construction Kit is a framework for bringing the open software ecosystems of oneAPI and SYCL to new, innovative hardware for AI acceleration and high-performance computing. With the oneAPI Construction Kit, hardware vendors can enable the SYCL programming model and open-source libraries for performance and portability with their hardware such as oneMKL for numerical computing or oneDNN for deep learning applications.</p>
<p>We’re proud to announce that the oneAPI Construction Kit is now under governance of the Unified Acceleration (UXL) Foundation. The UXL Foundation’s mission to build a multi-architecture, multi-vendor software ecosystem for all accelerators is well aligned with the purpose of the oneAPI Construction Kit, which enables heterogeneous and vendor-neutral code for the latest hardware architectures. By bringing the oneAPI Construction Kit under its governance, the UXL Foundation will encourage further collaboration and innovation between its members – and you can get involved, too, <a href="https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneapi-construction-kit">by visiting the GitHub</a> and trying the oneAPI Construction Kit yourself.</p>
<p>The oneAPI Construction Kit was recently introduced at the virtual <a>DevSummit</a> hosted by the UXL Foundation, and if you’re interested in learning more about this innovative project, <a href="https://oneapi.io/event-sessions/oneapi-construction-kit-uxl-q324/">you can watch the presentation from Andrew Richards</a> from Codeplay. This DevSummit was an impressive demonstration of the progress made by the UXL Foundation in its first year – whether it’s <a href="https://oneapi.io/event-sessions/onemcc-a-new-programming-interface-of-memory-centric-computing-uxl-q324/">Samsung’s new oneMCC library for memory centric computing</a> or <a href="https://oneapi.io/event-sessions/ge-healthcare-working-with-oneapi-uxl-q324/">GE Healthcare’s success with oneAPI</a>, the UXL Foundation is showing that by working collaboratively on open source software, we can innovate more effectively and create an open, vendor-neutral future for high-performance software that benefits all developers.</p>
<p>The oneAPI Construction Kit has already had an impact across Europe. It’s being used in two, pioneering EU-funded research projects – <a href="https://www.syclops.org/">SYCLOPS</a>, and <a href="https://aero-project.eu/">AERO</a>. The SYCLOPS Project is bringing together the open standards of both SYCL and RISC-V into a single, portable and performant stack, while the AERO Project is enabling the future heterogeneous EU cloud infrastructure to support the upcoming <a href="https://www.european-processor-initiative.eu/">EU Processor</a>. It’s also been used successfully by companies like Axelera AI and Embecosm to bring the oneAPI ecosystem to their hardware. <a href="https://www.codeplay.com/portal/blogs/2024/04/09/axelera-uses-oneapi-construction-kit-to-rapidly-enable-open-standards-programming-for-the-metis-aipu.html">We produced a case study with Axelera AI reflecting on their success</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqNWF26A8Io">Jeremy Bennett of Embecosm gave an insightful presentation</a> that explains how the oneAPI Construction Kit works, and how Embecosm has used it – it's well worth your time.</p>
<p>You can get involved with the UXL Foundation by visiting the <a href="https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneapi-construction-kit">oneAPI Construction Kit’s GitHub</a> to try it for yourself, and by <a href="https://uxlfoundation.org/membership">joining the Foundation as a member</a></p>
