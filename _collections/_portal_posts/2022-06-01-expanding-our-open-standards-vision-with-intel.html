         target="_blank">Codeplay&reg; CEO Response to Intel Blog post on oneAPI&trade;</a></b></p>

<p>Today Intel announced, pending final approvals, that it would acquire Codeplay Software. This is an
    exciting moment for the industry and will help enable the team to fulfill our vision of bringing
    open standards programming to all. Codeplay will continue to work in partnership with organizations
    across the industry to enable open standard software on the latest cutting edge processors.</p>

<p>Being a catalyst for industry innovation is what Codeplay was created to do, and it is what gets
    us excited to come to work. Over the past 20 years we have grown to be a leader in developing
    solutions for the latest processors. During this time, we have enabled more than 20 processors
    to use open standards programming models, and this close relationship with Intel will allow
    us to accelerate this work further.</p>

<p>Intel is focused on open standards, and Codeplay has led and contributed to multiple open standards
    including SYCL&trade;, a royalty free open standards programming model developed by the Khronos Group.
    In fact, our engineers have worked closely with engineers from Intel alongside other key
    organizations to bring the SYCL standard to the level of maturity it now has. Intel
    has chosen SYCL to be at the heart of the oneAPI initiative, a cross-industry,
    standards-based way to develop for heterogeneous architectures. The strength of
    oneAPI and SYCL scales from supercomputers with exascale (over 10^18 calculations
    per second) capability to edge compute devices and automotive ADAS. The end developer
    typically has thousands or millions of lines of code with software creation increasing each year.
    This code needs to be ported quickly and achieve highest performance benefiting from a
    well-supported ecosystem â€“ this is what oneAPI and SYCL provides.</p>

<p>This puts Codeplay in a strong position to work across the industry to bring SYCL and other
    open standards to both processor vendors and teams of software developers supporting the
    stated strategy of both parties. Codeplay is therefore at the heart of Intel's strategy
    to democratize oneAPI and SYCL, ensuring that all processors support open standards.</p>

<p>Intel's support will enable Codeplay's continued strength in the community and ecosystem.
    Codeplay will operate as a subsidiary business of Intel and will continue to support the
    multi-architecture, multi-vendor accelerator market. It is important for the industry to
    adopt open standards and open-specification solutions to minimize time-to-market for the
    industry and time to value for developers and customers. This acquisition strengthens
    developer and industry trust that open software will be available now and in the years to come.</p>

<p>Join Codeplay and Intel in celebrating this major milestone marking the next phase of high
    performance software driving advanced computing systems. The combination brings excitement
    and energy to oneAPI and SYCL ensuring the industry aligns and works together for the gain
    of all. This is just the next step in our vision to bring open standards programming to all.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to reaching further than before to discuss and engage with the next
    generation of performance computing solutions.</p>
