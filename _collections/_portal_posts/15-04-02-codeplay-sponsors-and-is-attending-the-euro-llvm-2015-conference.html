<p>
Codeplay is at its heart a compiler company, and has been using and contributing to the LLVM project for years. Our passion for the LLVM community and the opportunities that the LLVM tools provide mean we are always happy to be meeting like-minded people.
</p>
<p>
Attending from Codeplay will be Neil Henning, Deepak Panickal, JinGu Kang, Fraser Cormack, Pierre-Andre Saulais, Jakub Chlanda, Ewan Crawford, Meenakshi Ravindran, Lukas Kuklinek, Gordon Brown, and Colin Riley.
</p>
<p>
Deepak Panickal and Ewan Crawford will be presenting a talk, <strong>'Why Should I Use LLDB?'</strong> . Tackling the lack of information readily available for end-users outside of the official website, Deepak and Ewan will present LLDB from a user's point of view to provide an introduction to its interfaces and features. The talk will cover various interfaces that are available to the user, such as the standard command line interface, and Eclipse GUI through the LLDB-MI driver, and will conclude with an update on future developments, including rapidly improving support for platforms such as Windows.
</p>
<p>
Also presenting from Codeplay is Pierre-Andre Saulais, alongside Erkan Diken, Martin J. O'Riordan, and David Moloney of Movidius. Their talk,<strong> 'Challenges of mixed-width vector code generation and static scheduling in LLVM (for VLIW Architectures)'</strong>  presents some of the work done by Codeplay in collaboration with Movidius to optimise their LLVM-based compiler over the last year. The Myriad 2 processor that the compiler targets is based on Movidius' VLIW architecture, SHAVE. This talk will present some of the VLIW-related challenges we have faced and how we solved them.
</p>
<p>
Technology Lead, Neil Henning, will be presenting,<strong> 'Why SPIR-V? Motivation behind the new IL, and how Vulkan and OpenCL will use it' </strong> at the Khronos side-event at EuroLLVM. Neil has been part of the working group at Khronos for both Vulkan and SPIR-V. He will be covering a little history on how SPIR-V was created, which problems it solves, and how it will fit into with the wider open source community, before covering how OpenCL and Vulkan will use SPIR-V with some examples.
