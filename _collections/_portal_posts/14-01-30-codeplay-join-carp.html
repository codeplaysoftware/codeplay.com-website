<p>Codeplay are very pleased to announce our membership of the <a href="http://carp.doc.ic.ac.uk/external/index.php">CARP</a> European research project. <a href="http://carp.doc.ic.ac.uk/external/index.php">CARP</a> aims at improving the programmability of accelerated systems, particularly systems accelerated with GPUs, at all levels. This involves designing high-level programming formalisms geared towards accelerators, writing highly optimizing compilers to compile high-level code into efficient OpenCL, verifying correctness of accelerator kernels, and employing intensive symbolic testing techniques to find bugs.
</p>
<p>
Codeplay's contribution to <a href="http://carp.doc.ic.ac.uk/external/index.php">CARP</a> concerns the analysis and optimisation of mobile GPGPU applications. Efficient execution of applications on graphics hardware requires decisions to be made both at compile-time and run-time regarding data distribution and movement. These decisions affect execution time and energy efficiency, and are thus especially relevant when accelerating mobile applications. Recent innovations in industry-oriented GPGPU programming models targeting mobile platforms aim to ease the offloading of mobile applications. Attaining optimal performance on mobile GPUs requires an analysis of such a program's structure to mitigate the cost both of starting a kernel; and also of data transfers between kernels. In some cases, such analysis may determine that it is not worthwhile to offload some kernels to the GPU; depending on the size of the data, and the cost of accessing it. In other cases, the program will require to be transformed by the compiler to ensure a more optimial execution.

<p>
Within <a href="http://carp.doc.ic.ac.uk/external/index.php">CARP</a>, Codeplay will design and implement novel memory and code analyses, drawing on years of experience developing tools and applications for low-power heterogeneous platforms. This effort will facilitate the optimised acceleration of applications on mobile GPUs, and builds on top of technology developed during previous successful European projects such as <a href="http://www.peppher.eu/">PEPPHER</a>. Subsequently, these innovations will become incorporated within products made available to our customers and associated developers.

<p>
Codeplay now participate in two highly active European research projects: <a href="http://carp.doc.ic.ac.uk/external/index.php">CARP</a> and <a href="http://lpgpu.org">LPGPU</a>.</p>
