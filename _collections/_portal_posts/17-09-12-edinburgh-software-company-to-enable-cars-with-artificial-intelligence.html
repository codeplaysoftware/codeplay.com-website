<p><strong><a href="https://www.renesas.com/en-hq/about/press-center/news/2017/news20170912.html" target="_blank">Codeplay Software has announced it is working with Renesas</a></strong>, a leading Japanese semiconductor company, to enable their next generation of advanced automotive processors. The technology will be included in future cars that interpret the surroundings and safely take control to avoid accidents or aid with driving functions.</p>


<p>This new relationship will also attract at least 30 new software jobs into Edinburgh, further enhancing its reputation for attracting high-tech employment.</p>


<p>Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) is already available today in high-end cars providing functions such as adaptive cruise control and self parking. The next generation extends these functions relieving the driver of more responsibilities including steering, avoiding accidents and ultimately take full control towards the autonomous car.</p>


<p>Codeplay's software is using its technology and experience applied to games and mobile phones over the last 15 years to enable Renesas' latest automotive processors with an advanced vision processing and machine learning platform.</p>


<p>"Codeplay has already worked directly with the world's greatest processors providing advanced software solutions" said Andrew Richards, Founder and CEO of Codeplay Software, "We are excited to be enabling Renesas great products. It endorses the company's product and the leadership reputation of the software engineers".</p>

<p>Codeplay is a real home-grown, Scottish success story. Codeplay was founded by Andrew Richards and Jens-Uwe Dolinsky. Andrew started his career in the 8-bit days writing games for the ZX Spectrum from home, progressing up to writing large console games on the Sega Megadrive and PlayStation. He then decided he was interested in producing new technology for game developers to enable them to do new things. It was becoming possible to do some interesting new things on the graphics hardware that was being introduced. So he started a company with Uwe (who has a PhD in Robotics) to develop technology to let programmers take software they had written for normal computers and run it on new graphics-capable computers. It seemed like an interesting revolution that was about to happen. That was more than a decade ago and to be honest, it took a bit longer than he expected to happen!&nbsp;</p>


<p>Codeplay first operated in 2002 out of a small 2nd floor office in Edinburgh's Hanover St, before rapidly expanding until in 2017 they are proud to announce a staff of 70 in Argyle House, with 2 colleagues working remotely in Toronto and the Isle of Skye. During this period, Codeplay have always tried to maintain their friendly work culture along with the growth in their workforce and market reach. Codeplay is extremely proud of their Silver Accreditation from Investors in People and is actively working towards Gold Accreditation.</p>
