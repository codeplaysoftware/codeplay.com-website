<p>Andrew Richards, our CEO and Founder, will be presenting on  “Building an open, safe, accessible AI &amp; HPC ecosystem” on the 18<sup>th</sup> February at 4.15pm. The world of AI &amp; HPC is dominated by closed, proprietary software models. To get high performance today, systems need accelerators that have high levels of parallelism, but use closed programming models like CUDA.</p>

<p>How do we open this up? How do we make these models safe enough to drive a car? How do we get an industry to work together with industry standards? Andrew and Codeplay have been working on these challenges for years.</p>

<p>This talk will show the huge progress made today (SYCL, SPIR-V, oneAPI) and where we’re going next.</p>

<p>On its 9th consecutive edition, Multicore World 2020 participants are invited as world experts in their speciality. In a limited audience environment you will find that the person sitting besides you has a wealth of experience similar to the speaker that both are listening to.</p>

<p>Participants are from first tier companies, vendors and organisations -academia, science, government, engineering and development communities. You will hear about trends and road maps that are not yet in the general domain. You can’t substitute the experience of Multicore World’s unique combination of sessions and conversations. Webinars and white papers present knowledge to be marketed: at Multicore World you will discuss with the creators -right when they are keen to test their novel concept in your field.</p>
