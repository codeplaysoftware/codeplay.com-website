<p>Codeplay are looking to recruit a new member of staff to undertake a four year doctoral studentship, fully funded at a competitive rate.
</p>
<p>
The studentship is for an EngD qualification. This doctoral level qualification is similar to a PhD, but is more oriented towards industry and business than theory and academia.
</p>
<p>
The successful applicant's time would be split between working at Codeplay on compiler research and development, and studying advanced modules in computing science and electronic engineering at a selection of Scottish universities.
