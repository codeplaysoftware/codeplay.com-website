<p>Codeplay will be attending the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/iotEdinburgh/events/224329744/">IOT//EDINBURGH (Intelligent Transport)</a> event in Edinburgh on Monday 28 September., at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=+1+Summerhall,+Edinburgh+,+Edinburgh,+gb">TechCube Incubator, Summerhall</a>.
</p>
<p>
The event invites several ITS experts to speak about how the IoT and intelligent transport will transform our lives:
</p>
<p>
Vehicles of the future will be connected, powered by clean energy, driverless, shared and found in smart cities across the globe. Vehicle ownership will be unnecessary, as autonomous transportation devices will be summoned only when needed. All the wasted hours currently spent driving will be used to work, consume content, or be entertained. Fatalities will reduce dramatically, as will carbon emissions making for smarter, cleaner, safer urban spaces.
</p>
<p>
Codeplay engineer, Luke Iwanski, will be attending this event and giving a talk entitled, &quot;Safe Computer Vision Platforms for Autonomous Systems&quot; which will cover how Codeplay is tackling the problem of standardizing platforms for computer vision that are easy to develop for as well as being safe and reliable.
