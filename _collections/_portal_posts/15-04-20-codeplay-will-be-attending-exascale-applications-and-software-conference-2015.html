<p>Codeplay will be attending the <a href="http://www.easc2015.ed.ac.uk/home">easc2015</a> (Exascale Applications and Software Conference) event in Edinburgh on 21-23 April.

The aim of the conference is to bring together all of the stakeholders involved in solving the software challenges of the exascale – from application developers, through numerical library experts, programming model developers and integrators, to tools designers. EASC2015 is organised by EPCC at the University of Edinburgh.

One of Codeplay Software's Compiler Engineers, Alastair Murray, will be attending the event.
