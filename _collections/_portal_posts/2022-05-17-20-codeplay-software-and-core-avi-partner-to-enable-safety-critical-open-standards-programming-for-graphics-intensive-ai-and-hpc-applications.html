<p><i>Combining Codeplay's Acoran&trade; Platform Supporting SYCL™ and OpenCL™ with CoreAVI's VkCore® SC Vulkan
    SC-based GPU Acceleration Solution will Empower Safety Critical Embedded Multicore
    Applications for Autonomous Systems</i></p>

<p>Edinburgh, UK, 2022, May 18th, 2022 – Codeplay Software, a leader in enabling acceleration technologies for Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) and High-Performance Computing (HPC) development solutions, and CoreAVI, a
    global developer of real-time safety-critical GPU acceleration solutions,
    today announced their partnership to develop high-performance, embedded applications for
    safety critical automotive and industrial applications running on multicore real-time systems.</p>

<p>The combined software solutions from these companies will empower developers of advanced applications for
    automotive and other functional safety systems to develop, port, and execute their code on
    complex multiprocessor systems.</p>

<p>The result brings enhanced safety and ease of driving for motorists embracing the latest technologies
    available to car manufacturers.</p>

<p>According to Market Research, AI and vision processing solutions for ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems)
    and autonomous vehicles are projected to grow at a 21% annual rate and Computer Vision applications to
    grow 34% annually over the same period.</p>

<p>Both companies are pioneers in their respective fields. Codeplay leads the definition and creation
    of SYCL, The Khronos Group's open standard C++ programming model for heterogeneous processor
    architectures in AI and HPC.  CoreAVI is the premier provider of safety critical software for
    certifiable GPU acceleration solutions for safety-critical markets. CoreAVI also heads the
    Vulkan SC Working Group for Khronos. Through this partnership, Codeplay will integrate their
    Acoran Software Platform with CoreAVI's VkCore SC Platform.</p>

<p>Codeplay's Acoran Software Platform provides programmability, optimized processor-specific routines,
    and a wide ecosystem of domain-specific optimized libraries for exascale and artificial
    intelligence. A key foundation of Acoran is SYCL (pronounced “sickle”), an open standard
    programming model that enables heterogeneous programming based on standard ISO C++.
    Heterogeneous programming is the basis for today's growing HPC, AI, and machine learning
    applications. SYCL has been gaining momentum as embedded C++ developers look for a
    non-proprietary programming model.</p>

<p>VkCore SC is the foundation of CoreAVI's Platforms for Safety Critical Applications, addressing the
    needs of any safe GPU acceleration applications across all market verticals.
    The product suite is available with ISO 26262 ASIL D or IEC 61508 SIL 3 Safety Packages for
    automotive or industrial platforms, as well as the DO-178C/ED-12C safety certification
    packages required for avionics applications.</p>

<p>"Our wide range of customers in automotive, industrial and avionics have the highest demands for
    quality and safety and  they're  eager to apply AI and HPC to their embedded systems to meet the
    growing demand for autonomous solutions,” said Damian Fozard, CEO at CoreAVI. “We are excited to
    partner with Codeplay to extend open standards into heterogeneous programming models
    to our customers."</p>

<p>"All ADAS systems require true real-time decisions when fusing the data from many cameras and sensors",
    said Andrew Richards, CEO and founder of Codeplay Software, "By combining our SYCL implementation
    with CoreAVI's Vulkan SC implementation, we bring extensive programmability and real time
    performance to application developers. Safety is critical with both companies focused
    on the highest standards in software."</p>

<p>“The Khronos Group is excited to see members work together to create cutting edge solutions,” said
    Neil Trevett, President, Director of The Khronos Group. “We are the standards group for major
    technology initiatives and safety is incredibly important to the growth of AI and HPC."</p>

<h2>About Codeplay Software</h2>

<p>Codeplay Software is a world pioneer in enabling acceleration technologies used in AI, HPC and automotive.
    Codeplay was established in 2002 in Edinburgh, Scotland and developed some of the first tools enabling
    complex software to be accelerated using graphics processors. Today, most AI software is developed
    using graphics processors designed for video games, and more recently specialized AI and computer
    vision accelerators. Codeplay continues to work with global technology leaders to make the latest
    complex AI systems programmable using open standards based programming languages and allows
    application developers to quickly bring software to the market.  Codeplay is also deeply
    involved with the definition of open standards, especially OpenCL™, SPIR™, SYCL™, and Vulkan™
    through The Khronos Group, and MISRA C++ for automotive.</p>
