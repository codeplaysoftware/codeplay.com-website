<p>Codeplay will be attending the <a href="https://stacresearch.com/spring2016LON">STAC Summit</a> in London on 10 May.
</p>
<p>
STAC provides technology research and testing tools based on community-source standards. This accelerates technology selection at user firms while reducing the sales cycle for vendors. The standards are developed by the STAC Benchmark Council, a group of major financial firms and other &quot;algorithmic enterprises&quot; as well as leading technology vendors. Through a variety of online and in-person forums, the Council discusses key technology challenges and new solutions for them. Follow the links below for more information.
</p>
<p>
STAC meetings bring together industry leaders to focus on challenging areas of financial technology. They range from large in-person gatherings (STAC Summits) to webinars and working group teleconferences.
</p>
<p>
Attending from Codeplay will be our VP of Research and Development, Michael Wong. He will be participating on the panel, &quot;What HFT wants from C++ (and how to get it)&quot;.
