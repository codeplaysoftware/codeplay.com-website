<p>Codeplay is pleased to announce that its engineers will be attending and presenting at the <a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-10">2014 LLVM Developers' Meeting</a> being held on October 28th and 29th in San José, US.
</p>
<p>
Compiler Engineers Fraser Cormack and Pierre-André Saulais will present a talk on <a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-10/#tutorial1">Building an LLVM Backend</a>, showcasing how to get started on building an LLVM backend for a new architecture.
</p>
<p>
Debugger Team Lead, Deepak Mathews Panickal, will be presenting a BoF on <a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-10/#bof5">Future Directions and Features for LLDB</a>, to openly discuss new features such as supporting simultaneous multiple targets, MI driver, lldb-gdbserver, etc. We will also be working out how LLDB can support heterogeneous systems, like CPUs and GPUs, as well as how it can support more platforms and IDEs. Codeplay has long-term expertise in building compilers and debuggers, especially with esoteric architectures.
