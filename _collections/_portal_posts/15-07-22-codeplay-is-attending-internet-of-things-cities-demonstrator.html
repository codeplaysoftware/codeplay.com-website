<p>
The aim of this demonstrator is to show how the large-scale deployment of IoT – where everyday objects are connected to a network in order to share their data – can benefit citizens by offering environmental improvements, economic opportunities, and more efficient and effective delivery of services such as transport, healthcare and energy.

<p>
Two of Codeplay Software's engineers, Alastair Murray and Jeroen Ketema, will be attending this event.
