<p><img src="{{ '/assets/images/portal/article-images/IWOCL2021Banner.png' | relative_url }}"></p><p>This year is expected to be the biggest IWOCL &amp; SYCLcon
conference of all time and Codeplay is contributing with various
sessions over 4 days from <strong>26-29 April</strong>. The conference
is online for the second year in a row and couldn't be easier to attend -
 it's free and on demand with some live elements. Register now on the <a href="https://www.iwocl.org/">conference website</a>.</p><p><strong>What's happening at IWOCL and SYCLcon 2021</strong></p><p>On <strong>Monday 26th April</strong> (10:00am-6:00pm CET) in partnership with IWOCL and SYCLcon is the <strong><a href="https://www.oneapi.com/events/devcon2021iwocl/">oneAPI Developer Summit</a>. </strong>oneAPI
 is a cross-industry standards-based platform with SYCL at its core and
offering a set of libraries to enable specific compute inntensive
operations. The agenda for this event is looking very interesting,
kicking off with a panel discussion involving some of the SYCL
implementers including ComputeCpp represented by Codeplay's <b>Peter Zuzek</b>
and DPC++ for CUDA represented by Codeplay's <b>Steffen Larsen</b>. The
remainder of the day brings a good mix of talks from HPC developers
making use of SYCL and organizations implementing open standards on
different hardware platforms. In particular Biagio Cosenza from the
University of Salerno will be talking about how his cross-organization
team brought SYCL to the Celerity framework which is being used on
massively parallel systems.</p><p>If you are new to SYCL programming or want to brush up your SYCL skills, you need to block off the day on <strong>Tuesday 27th April</strong> and join the <strong><a href="https://www.iwocl.org/iwocl-2021/conference-program/">Hands-On Introduction to SYCL Tutorial</a></strong>.
 This session is being presented live by engineers from Codeplay, Intel,
 University of Heidelberg and Xilinx who are some of the most
experienced experts in SYCL. The session is very focused on hands-on
work and is a great way to grasp the essentials you will need for SYCL
development. By the end of the day we expect you to be able to write
your own SYCL kernels and understand the main concepts required to build
 more complex applications.</p><p>On <strong>Tuesday 27th April at 10:00am CET </strong>IWOCL
 and SYCLcon moves to technical presentations, panels and poster
sessions with more than 20 technical talks on both OpenCL and SYCL
selected by a programming committee of experts from across the industry.
 Codeplay has 5 separate presentations covering some of the work we have
 been doing in the past 12 months, and I'll talk about some of these and
 why you should watch them.</p><p>As part of the keynotes, Codeplay's <strong>Michael Wong</strong> will present his annual "<strong>State of the Union.</strong>"
 Michael is the chair for the SYCL Working Group and will give an update
 on the SYCL standard's evolution and state of the SYCL community.</p><p>Codeplay
 is playing a huge part in helping developers migrate away from
proprietary CUDA to SYCL through our contribution of DPC++ for CUDA.
<b>Steffen Larsen</b> along with our partners from Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory have contributed a poster session entitled "<strong>Bringing SYCL to Ampere Architecture</strong>." This describes the work Codeplay is doing to <a href="https://www.codeplay.com/portal/press-releasess/2021/02/02/nersc-alcf-codeplay-partner-on-sycl-for-next-generation-supercomputers.html">bring SYCL programming to the Nvidia A100 based Perlmutter supercomputer</a>
 which will be used by the US National Laboratories for running crucial
research applications. Find out how to try out SYCL with your Nvidia GPU
 by visiting the poster session.</p><p>An area that is rapidly evolving is the use of SYCL and OpenCL in safety critical applications such as automotive. <strong>Illya Rudkin</strong>
 from Codeplay has been working on understanding the challenges that
integrating SYCL and OpenCL into vehicles brings, in particular as the
evolution towards autonomous vehicles approaches. Illya examines how
open standards bring a host of benefits to this area but also talks
through the challenges that we are also facing. Make sure to join the "<strong>Can SYCL and OpenCL Meet the Challenges of Functional Safety?</strong>" session if you would like to learn more about this, and also how you can contribute to moving SYCL forward in safety critical.</p><p>Machine
 learning has increased the use of programs that are based on graphs,
and has made graph programming accessible to even novice programmers. <strong>Erik Tomusk</strong>
 from Codeplay will explain how OpenCL can be used to express graphs for
 accelerator processors efficiently and with high performance in the
talk "<strong>Executing Graphs with OpenCL</strong>." There are some
misconceptions about how graph programming can map to OpenCL and this
talk will help to convince you about the best solutions for machine
learning applications.</p><p>System-on-chip manufacturers are building
specialist accelerator processors based on the RISC-V architecture, and
the Vectorized (RVV) extension enables these to match compute
performance seen on GPUs today. <strong>Colin Davidson</strong> and <b>Aidan Dodds</b> from Codeplay present "<strong>Enabling OpenCL and SYCL for RISC-V processors</strong>"
 where they explain how Codeplay is enabling OpenCL and SYCL for
processors implementing the RVV extension, and how this can be adapted
for a wide range of hardware types.</p><p>The annual <strong>OpenCL and SYCL panels</strong> will take place on <strong>Wednesday 28th and Thursday 29th</strong> respectively at 17:00 CET live involving <strong>Alastair Murray and Michael Wong</strong> from Codeplay. These panels are live and give you the opportunity to ask those difficult questions of the experts.</p><p><strong>Why you Should Attend IWOCL and SYCLcon 2021</strong></p><p>From
 Codeplay's experience the past 2 years has seen huge momentum behind
the SYCL open standard, and we are seeing more and more developers
migrating their codebases from CUDA to SYCL. This is making it possible
to escape proprietary lock in and brings the opportunity to target many
processors from different manufacturers. From the conference program we
can see evidence that many of the world's semiconductor companies are
adopting openness, from Intel's migration to open source and open
standard support for their processors, through to Kalray's adoption of
OpenCL for their latest generation of chipsets. SYCLcon is also probably
 the best conference for not only learning how to develop with SYCL but
to also see the very latest research, and there are many very relevant
papers in cutting edge fields.</p><p><strong>How you can Watch and Interact with the Presentations</strong></p><p>Simply <a href="https://www.iwocl.org/">register on the IWOCL/SYCLcon website</a>
 to get free access for all the sessions. You'll be sent instructions
before the conference on how to join the live sessions, and links to
where the recorded presentations will be available when published from
the 27th to 29th of April.</p><p><strong>Talk to Codeplay at IWOCL and SYCLcon</strong></p><p>While
 it's a different experience when attending an online conference it's
still possible to have interesting discussions, and learn new things
from your peers by participating through the online channels.</p><p>We'd also like to make it possible to interact with attendees from Codeplay as if the conference were a physical event.</p><p>The
 conference has set up Slack channels that enable participants to chat,
debate and provide an opportunity to ask the presenters questions on
their talks. More details will be shared by the organizers.</p><p>Additionally,
 if you participate in the SYCL tutorial sessions, or the live talks you
 can post your questions live on our channels and the team will be
online ready to answer and discuss them.</p><p>You can also engage with the team on social media channels.</p><p>Find Codeplay on <a href="https://twitter.com/codeplaysoft">Twitter</a> if you have any questions.</p><p>Our <strong>CEO Andrew Richards</strong> is a regular <a href="https://twitter.com/codeandrew">on Twitter</a>, and is always keen to debate about parallel programming and processors.</p><p><strong>Rod Burns</strong>, our <strong>VP Ecosystem</strong> is <a href="https://www.twitter.com/rodburns">on Twitter</a> and is always interested to know what developers are looking for from SYCL.</p><p>Join us and many others from the community for IWOCL and SYCLcon online. <a href="https://www.iwocl.org/">Register on the event website</a> and log on from the <strong>26th-29th of April</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>SYCL is a trademark of the Khronos Group Inc.
