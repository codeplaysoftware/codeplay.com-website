<p>Codeplay will be attending Code::dive, which is being held from the 15th-16th November at the Kino Nowe Horyzonty, Wroc?aw, Poland.</p>
<p><b>Attending from Codeplay will be Michael Wong, VP  Research and Development, Andrzej Warzynski, Staff Software Engineer,Debuggers &amp; Jakub Chlanda, Staff Software Engineer, GPGPU Systems.</b></p>
<p><em>'code::dive is a non-profit, annual conference for C++ enthusiasts . The main idea behind the conference is to share the knowledge beyond cutting edge technologies and build networking between people.</em></p>
<p><em>The first and second edition of the conference, which seems to have found a permanent slot in Poland’s IT calendar, offered participants a chance to hear well known programming  experts: Scott Meyers, Venkat Subramaniam, Andrei Alexandrescu, Dan Sacks, Ulrich Drepper and many local stars, like Andrzej Krzemienski, Bartosz Szurgot and many more...</em></p>
<p><em>No one so far has claimed to be bored during code::dive conference in Wroclaw, so the organisers want to make the third code:dive even better</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;The third edition of code::dive will offer many interesting topics from the  C++ world, including:</em></p>
<p><ul><li><em><span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;">talks</span><br></em></li><li><em><span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;">interesting panel discussions</span><br></em></li><li><em><span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;">lightning talks</span><br></em></li></ul></p>
<p><em>The conference  will start from C++17 news, then try to understand, how to make C++ easier, faster and safer to finally land up with understanding how compilers can be optimized.</em></p>
<p><em>There will be plenty of time for panels, discussions and Q&amp;As'</em></p>
<p><em>More information on the conference can be found here: <a href="http://codedive.pl/en/index/#program-section"><strong><u>Code::dive</u></strong></a></em></p>
<p>Michael will be giving a presentation on Tuesday 15th November, 09.15am: <strong><u>C++, Will it be great or just OK (And C++ future for the Heterogeneous Dispatch to Self Driving cars) (2016)</u></strong>  The presentation will highlight some of the following: <em>C++17 has promised to be a major release from C++11/14. This will be one of the first talks on C++17 showing the major features. There will be Filesystems, Parallelism, and Special Math, as well as a large number of language and library features, but nothing major like the Move semantics in C++11 that changed C++ for every user. Many other features were already baked in through the various Study Groups. C++ has 14 study groups that act as Evolution Committees, promising to keep features coming for years. There will be Co-routines, Concepts, contracts, modules, ranges, reflection, Transactional Memory coming, but none of these major features made it into C++17. Concepts and many other major features were pulled out or not voted in at the last Standard meeting, causing great controversy on the internet. What were the committee thinking and why? And what did we get and will it change C++17 the way C++11 changed C++98/04 into a new language? This talk will deep dive into how C++ supports Parallelism and Concurrency, how Executors work and how they intend to address Heterogeneous computing in future C++ and how this can help to program self-driving cars.</em></p>&nbsp;<span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;">Codeplay is also proud to announce the launch of their ComputeCpp™ Community Edition Beta, enabling <a href="https://www.codeplay.com/products/computesuite/computecpp"><strong><u>Early Access to the SYCL Open Standard for C++ Acceleration</u></strong></a></span>
