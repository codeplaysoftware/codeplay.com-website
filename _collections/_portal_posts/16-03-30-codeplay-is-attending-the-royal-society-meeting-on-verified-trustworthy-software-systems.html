<p>Codeplay will be attending the <a href="https://verificationinstitute.org/event/verified-trustworthy-software-systems-specialist-meeting/"> Royal Society meeting on Verified Trustworthy Software Systems</a> at Imperial College London from 4 - 7 April.
</p>
<p>
Software faults cause widespread problems in society. Symbolic verification provides promising solutions to these problems. The field is coming of age: verification techniques scale; tools are tractable; and real-world programs can be verified. These meetings bring together academics, industrial experts and government scientists to identify key challenges in establishing verification at the heart of the software design process.
</p>
<p>
The meetings' talks and discussions will comprise verification experts, systems and security experts interested in verification, industrialists using verification, government scientists thinking about verification challenges in cyber security and the certification of software, renowned experts as well as promising young researchers from the fields of verification, systems, and security.
