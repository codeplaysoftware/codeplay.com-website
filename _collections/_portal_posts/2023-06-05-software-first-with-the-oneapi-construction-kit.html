<p>Bring the open and standards-based SYCL™ programming model to your custom accelerator with the oneAPI
 Construction Kit.</p>

<p><b>[June 5, 2023 - Edinburgh]</b> Today, Codeplay&reg; Software announces the latest extension of the oneAPI
 ecosystem with an open source project that allows code written in SYCL to run on custom architectures for HPC
 and AI. The oneAPI Construction Kit includes a reference implementation for RISC-V® vector processors but can
 be adapted for a range of processors, and is the latest step in our mission to build out the open ecosystem for
 accelerated computing.</p>

<p>
    With software evolving quickly, it has become increasingly common for hardware vendors to create specialist AI
    processors that run their software more efficiently than would be possible with out-of-the-box hardware. While these
    custom processors can offer the advantage of performance, they come with challenges for developers. Primary among
    these is the challenge of enabling the latest software on the latest generation of processors. This can involve
    major software porting efforts to proprietary and non-standard programming models, creating additional work for
    customers, who will need to work on time-consuming optimizations and porting for their applications.
</p>
<p>
    The oneAPI Construction Kit was created to solve these challenges by bringing all the benefits of simplified
    heterogeneous programming to custom hardware. It extends oneAPI to custom architectures and makes it easy to access
    a wealth of supported SYCL libraries. This has tangible benefits for your customers who, rather than having to learn
    a new custom language for custom hardware, can instead use SYCL to write high-performance applications efficiently.
    All of this means less time spent on porting efforts and maintaining separate codebases for different architectures,
    and more time for innovation.
</p>
<p>
    Codeplay has previously demonstrated a full software programming environment using oneAPI and SYCL for the next
    generation of RISC-V vector processors using the oneAPI Construction Kit, and in this short clip below, our CEO and
    co-founder Andrew Richards demonstrates this by running code using an Intel CPU and a custom FPGA simulating a
    RISC-V accelerator.
