<p><span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;">Codeplay are delighted to announce that we will be attending the 27th International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications from the 4th-8th September, Ghent, Belgium. Attending from Codeplay this year will be <strong><u>Ralph Potter, Senior Software Engineer, Research</u></strong>. Ralph will be presenting at the following workshop: <strong>Reconfigurable Computing for Deep Learning</strong>, where he will be presenting the following topic: <strong>Extending TensorFlow to Heterogeneous Processors Using SYCL</strong></span></p>
<p><em style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;">'TensorFlow has become the most popular machine learning framework, gaining huge adoption since being published as an open-source project. Developers are using Google's TensorFlow to solve some of the world's most difficult problems, and whilst it was originally designed for use on high-performance computers with power-hungry processors, there is an increasing need to run machine learning applications on a diverse range of heterogeneous processors, including FPGAs.&nbsp;</em><em style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;">The Khronos Group's OpenCL open standard provides a programming model for a wide range of heterogeneous processors, including FPGAs from Altera and Xilinx. SYCL, another Khronos Group open standard provides a single-source C++ programming model for OpenCL devices. In this talk, we will describe our work to bring support for OpenCL devices to TensorFlow, and how the SYCL programming model can bridge the gap between hardware accelerators and the high-level abstractions used by TensorFlow. This provides a potential route towards FPGA support within TensorFlow'.</em></p>
<p><em style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;">The International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL) was the first and remains the largest conference covering the rapidly growing area of field-programmable logic and reconfigurable computing. During the past 26 years, many of the advances in reconfigurable system architectures, applications, embedded processors, design automation methods and tools were first published in the proceedings of the FPL conference series. The conference objective is to bring together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry and from around the world.
