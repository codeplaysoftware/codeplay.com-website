Codeplay will be attending the <a href="http://www.dream-marketing.co.uk">Automotive Technology Roadshow</a> across various locations between 29 February - 11 March.
</p>
<p>
Utilising a unique exhibition trailer with up to 24 exhibition stands, companies will showcase their technologies and services on board. Prime sites will be visited to meet with the Engineering, Production, Design and Development Teams who rarely get a chance these days to visit more traditional trade shows. The Automotive Tour runs every March and visits both OEM and Tier 1 organisations across the UK and Germany. Ford, Land Rover, Jaguar, Honda, Visteon, Toyota, BMW, Delphi and others will be in attendance.
