the popular RISC-V processors will make it easier to port existing HPC and AI
software for embedded systems</h2></div><div><br></div>Edinburgh, UK, October 29th, 2020
 – Codeplay Software Ltd, pioneers in enabling acceleration
technologies, announced today that software developers working on HPC
and AI for embedded systems will be able to take advantage of industry
defined open standards from The Khronos Group on RISC-V architectures,
thanks to Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development
Organisation (“NEDO”) project in which NSITEXE and Kyoto Microcomputer
Co., Ltd. (“KMC”) are participating. <br><br><div>NSITEXE
 and KMC have ordered an implementation of LLVM for RISC-V Vector
Extension Processor (“RVV”), and also Codeplay’s ComputeAorta™ and
ComputeCpp™, efficient and high performance implementations of OpenCL
and SYCL open standards. In the NEDO project, as a research, NSITEXE
develops OpenCL and SYCL compilers from LLVM to utilize RVV, and KMC
implements vector syntax to utilize RVV efficiently based on LLVM and
Clang.&nbsp; These research developments will contribute to RISC-V community
to support open-standard technologies.</div><div><br></div>By
porting Codeplay’s OpenCL and SYCL open standards products, developers
targeting the RVV for AI accelerators will be able to program RISC-V’s
open hardware implementations using familiar C++, easily port existing
code from other AI systems and take advantage of an extensive ecosystem
of tools, libraries, training and skilled talent. Applications using
this architecture range from high performance computing (“HPC”),
automotive, and machine learning. <br><br><div>The
development is being defined by NSITEXE and KMC, with funding from NEDO.
 The motivation is to develop next-generation computing technologies for
 AI chips that enable highly efficient and high-speed processing to
solve some of the world’s most complex challenges, from self-driving
vehicles to climate change.</div><div><br></div><div>Andrew Richards,
Founder and CEO of Codeplay Software, says “The growth in adopting the
SYCL standard for programming AI systems, and the strong interest in
RISC-V open processors in all market segments makes this project
extremely important to all involved. This engagement with both NSITEXE
and KMC is the start of an exciting step for us, enabling the RISC-V
ecosystem with our ComputeAorta for OpenCL and ComputeCpp for SYCL
products. Codeplay has been deeply involved in SYCL, from definition to
enabling systems with our ComputeCpp product, and we strongly believe it
 is the only software standard to link all the AI accelerators to a
unified programming solution.”</div><div><br></div><div>Michael Wong,
Chair of SYCL in Khronos and Distinguished Engineer with Codeplay, says
“This growth in standardization for programming high performance
accelerators like RISC-V will enable AI software developers to bring
advanced intelligence to many market segments, from exascale computers
to edge and automotive. SYCL is a modern C++ programming language that
allows software developers to take advantage of the latest industry
agreed standards and benefit from the growing ecosystem.”</div><div><br></div><div>Hideki
 Sugimoto, CTO NSITEXE Inc. says “The NEDO project will develop OpenCL
and SYCL compilers to utilize the RISC-V Vector extension for embedded
systems. By applying Codeplay's ComputeAorta and ComputeCpp technology,
we expect that we can bring state-of-art technology to RISC-V community
with our research results.”</div><div><br></div><div>Shoichi Yamamoto,
President &amp; CEO Kyoto Microcomputer Co.,Ltd. says "Based on LLVM
compiler back-end customization for RISC-V by Codeplay Software Ltd., we
 are able to implement vector syntax to utilize RVV efficiently. We are
excited to work with experienced and skilled engineers from Codeplay
Software Ltd., the leading company in compiler development".</div><div><br></div><div>Calista
 Redmond, CEO, RISC-V International says “We are excited to welcome
Codeplay as a Strategic member of RISC-V International. They are the
very definition of a RISC-V Community Member with the way they have
brought technologies and contribute to the NEDO project and are focused
on open-standards based programming languages. As they bring RISC-V
solutions to AI, HPC, exascale, and automotive industries, we are
looking forward to the RISC-V growth in those markets, enabled by
Codeplay and NSITEXE.”</div><div><br></div><h2><b>About NSITEXE:</b></h2>NSITEXE, Inc.,
