<p>In the <a href="https://cppcast.com/sycl-michael-wong/">latest episode of CppCast</a> Codeplay VP of Research &amp; Development Michael Wong talks about the provisional specification of SYCL 2020. The specification has now been released and Michael joined Rob and Jason to give an introduction to what SYCL is, and why the latest revision brings some great new features, as well as less verbose, simpler code.<br></p>
<p>They cover a range of other topics, from the challenges of moving MISRA, a standard used for safety critical applications such as vehicles, to use more modern C++ features like templates and dynamic memory, through to his involvement in aligning the ISO C++ standard with SYCL to support parallel programming.</p>
