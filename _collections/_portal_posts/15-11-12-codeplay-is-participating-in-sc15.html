Codeplay will be present throughout the event at the OpenCL Booth, in booth #285 on the west side of the hall, where, as well as meeting our technical experts who will be available to answer your questions, you can:
</p><ul>
<li> Meet some of the OpenCL, SPIR™, and SYCL™ working group members</li>
<li> Learn about the NEW OpenCL 2.1</li>
<li> Get your free OpenCL, SYCL, and SPIR stickers</li>
<li> Find free reference guides for OpenCL 2.1 and SYCL 1.2</li>
</ul>
<p>
Codeplay's CEO, Andrew Richards, along with two of our expert engineers, Gordon Brown and Ruyman Reyes, will be attending this event.
</p>
<p>
On the Wednesday at 3:30pm in Room 12AB, Andrew will be delivering a talk called, “<a href="http://sc15.supercomputing.org/schedule/event_detail?evid=exforum101">SYCL For OpenCL: Accelerate High-Performance Software On GPUs, CPUs, FPGAs And Other Processors Using Open Standards In C++</a>.” The talk will present the SYCL open standard, as well as demonstrate implementations of SYCL and show how using C++ and open standards can deliver huge performance, quickly and easily across a range of hardware platforms.
</p>
<p>
Later that day, at 5:30pm in Room 17AB, our team will be participating in the BOF session, &quot;<a href="http://sc15.supercomputing.org/schedule/event_detail?evid=bof142">Flocking Together: Experience the Diverse OpenCL Ecosystem</a>&quot;. Members of the SYCL working group, including our team, will be talking about updates to the SYCL and OpenCL specifications. We will start with an overview of the newly released OpenCL 2.1 C++ kernel language and SYCL 2.1 abstraction layers. Then attendees will have the opportunity to experiment with implementations and tools from multiple vendors, and we will have engineers available to demo ComputeCpp™ with SYCL. We invite attendees to bring their code and their toughest questions and join the OpenCL petting zoo.
