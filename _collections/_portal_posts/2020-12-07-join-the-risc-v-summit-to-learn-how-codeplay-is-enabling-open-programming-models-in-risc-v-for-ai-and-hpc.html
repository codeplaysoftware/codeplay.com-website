Developers will soon benefit from open standards-based software on open source instruction set processors with vector acceleration. <br></p><p>This year, Codeplay is proud to sponsor and support the <a href="https://tmt.knect365.com/risc-v-summit/">RISC-V Summit from 8th – 10th December</a>. The momentum behind RISC-V has received huge attention this year and the time is right for Codeplay to contribute familiar open standards programming platforms, opening up a large ecosystem for application developers. <br></p><p>Codeplay will be enabling RISC-V vector processors (RVV) with open standards-based software that provides Artificial Intelligence (AI) and High Performance Computing (HPC) application developers with a familiar programming environment and ecosystem. Using open standard interfaces for programming high performance RISC-V accelerators will enable these software developers to bring advanced intelligence to many market segments, from exascale computers to edge and automotive. <br></p><p>With the recent industry demands to accelerate AI, cloud computing and computer vision, RISC-V enabled systems have become relevant and attractive processing platforms for many System-on-Chip (SOC) developers delivering into HPC and automotive ADAS systems. The existing software ecosystem based on OpenCL and SYCL will provide a familiar C++ platform, giving software developers the ability to easily port existing code from other AI systems as well as bringing an extensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, training and skilled talent. <br></p><p>Codeplay recently announced a <a href="https://www.codeplay.com/portal/press-releasess/2020/10/29/nsitexe-kyoto-microcomputer-and-codeplay-software-are-bringing-open-standards-programming-to-risc-v-vector-processor-for-hpc-and-ai-systems.html">project with NSITEXE and Kyoto Microcomputer Co., Ltd. (“KMC”)</a>, thanks to Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organisation (“NEDO”) to bring OpenCL and SYCL support to RISC-V Vector Extension Processors (RVV). This will be the first step to integrating Codeplay’s ComputeAorta and ComputeCpp products, providing OpenCL and SYCL open standards programming platform on RVV.
