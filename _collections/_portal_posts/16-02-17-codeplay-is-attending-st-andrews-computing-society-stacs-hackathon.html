<p>Codeplay will be attending the <a href="http://stacshack.org">St. Andrews Computing Society (STACS) Hackathon</a>, from 20 - 21 February.
</p>
<p>
The St Andrews Computing Society connects students who share an interest in computing and technology. They hold social events that empower hackers to meet new people and learn new skills.
</p>
<p>
The Hackathon gathers groups of participants to create unique and innovative projects in just 24 hours - a &quot;jam session for makers&quot;.
</p>
<p>
Attending from Codeplay will be Simon Brand and Peter Carragher. We’re always delighted to speak with anyone interested in what we’re doing, so please come and say &quot;hello&quot;.
