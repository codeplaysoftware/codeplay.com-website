<p>SCE-licensed game developers can now download the release of Codeplay Offload. We have a new tutorial that shows how, with just a few lines source-code-modifications, you can get 2x performance improvement on typical game code. Licensed game developers need to go through the usual SCE approval process, which requires access to the SCE developer website.
</p>
<p>
Codeplay Offload&trade; is available for free, but users must credit use of the system on game packaging and splash screens. Prices for professional user-support will be announced shortly. The Cell Linux version of Codeplay Offload&trade; is undergoing final testing and integration work.
</p>
<p>
The system allows full C++ source to be offloaded to SPU, with minimal source-code changes (surprisingly few source-code changes in most cases. As little as just switching compilers and marking out a code section.) A source-level debugger is provided.
</p>
<p>
Codeplay is working on C++ library routines to enable easy parallelism across heterogeneous multicores, and invites others to do the same. The Offload&trade; system is particularly suitable for C++ template-programming to enable easy parallelism and offloading. Our tutorial shows a good example of this.
