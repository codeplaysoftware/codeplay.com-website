<p>Codeplay will be attending the 2016 <a href="https://www.mobileworldcongress.com">GSMA Mobile World Congress</a> in Barcelona from 22 – 25 February.
</p>
<p>
The mobile industry continues to be characterised by high levels of growth and opportunity, and as the industry becomes more dynamic, the opportunities within it increase in equal amount, as do the challenges. In 2016, the Mobile World Congress conference programme will provide an essential, in-depth coverage of the contemporary and future mobile industry, highlighting specific areas of growth and opportunity.
</p>
<p>
Running across the full length of the Mobile World Congress, the 2016 conference programme will continue to be a central focus for the event, challenging and educating delegates while covering the latest technological developments, next generation services and growth strategies.
