<p>Two of Codeplay’s Research Engineers will attend the 5th Multicore Challenge, which will take place at the University of the West of England, Bristol, UK on the 23rd of September.
</p>
<p>
Head of Research, Dr. Paul  Keir, and Games Technology Programmer, Luke Iwanski, will present Codeplay’s prototype implementation of the upcoming SYCL™ for OpenCL™ specification. During the session we will walk through a number of small SYCL programs and features.
For more information see <a href="http://www.testandverification.com/conferences/multicore-challenge/multicore-challenge-2014/multicore-tool-demo-codeplay-software/">our page on the Multicore Challenge website</a>.
If you are curious about what SYCL is, or you‘re interested in GPGPU and heterogenous programming, please stop by our demo pod.
See you there!
