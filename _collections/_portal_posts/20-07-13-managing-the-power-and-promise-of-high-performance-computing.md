HPC is being used in an increasingly wide variety of fields, with AI the fastest growing area of this decade. I expect to see an explosion of growth in the coming years, fuelled by new processors and industry software programmability.

There is a momentum behind the Khronos&reg; standard SYCL&trade; as an open standard alternative to proprietary programming interfaces like CUDA.

I've written [an article in IEEE](https://www.computer.org/publications/tech-news/trends/managing-the-power-and-promise-of-high-performance-computing) talking about what I expect to see in HPC, including for the upcoming exascale supercomputers.
