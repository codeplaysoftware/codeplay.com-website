<p>Codeplay will be attending <a href="http://www.talentscotland.com/work/companies/t/talentscotland/jobs/scotland-online-digital-jobs-day-tfcvxdesqa">Scotland Online Digital Jobs Day</a> <a href="https://www.europeanjobdays.eu/en/jobseeker/register">online</a> on Wednesday 9 March.
</p>
<p>
Our own engineers, Luke Iwanski and Ruyman Reyes, will be representing Codeplay as part of 10 great Scottish companies who are taking part in the Jobs Day. Participating employers have a wide range of exciting opportunities for enthusiastic graduates and experienced professionals. We will be online to chat about upcoming opportunities with Codeplay, as well as information for those considering living and working in Scotland - from how the sector is growing and the thriving tech community, to what it is like living in the cities and countryside!
