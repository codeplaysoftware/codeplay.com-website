<p>The <a href="https://sc21.supercomputing.org/">SuperComputing SC21</a>
conference is over, and I've been eager to see all the SYCL papers and
presentations published on various topics. I wrote about all the SYCL
activities at SC21 <a href="https://www.codeplay.com/portal/blogs/2021/11/10/bringing-the-latest-sycl-research-to-sc21.html">in my previous blog post</a> and now I want to pick out some of the highlights.</p>
<p>The first day of the conference involved many concurrent sessions with
around 16 different workshops, as well as a <a href="https://www.oneapi.io/events/oneapi-developer-summit-at-sc">full day of content at the oneAPI Developer Summit</a>. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.oneapi.io/events/oneapi-developer-summit-at-sc">oneAPI Developer Summit</a> focused largely on developers using SYCL with a
range of sessions from tutorials and technical presentations to the closing
panel session and this year there. This time there was a real focus on
migrating code from CUDA to SYCL and the work that Codeplay has been doing to
bring Nvidia GPU support to oneAPI is crucial for this. </p>
<p>Early in the day there was <a href="https://www.oneapi.io/event-sessions/developing-for-nvidia-gpus-using-sycl-with-oneapi/">an hour long session</a> by Codeplay engineer Joe Todd who explained how
easy it is to migrate from CUDA to SYCL while still targeting Nvidia GPUs with
great performance. The session included a code along section which you can watch back to
understand how to set up your own environment with oneAPI for CUDA. This session
is a great way to get a kick start your development journey from CUDA to SYCL.</p>
<p><br></p><p><img src="{{ '/assets/images/portal/article-images/sc21close.png' | relative_url }}" width="615" height="350"></p><p>To complement this, Eric Nielson from NASA with Mohammed Zubair from Old
Dominion University presented their <a href="https://www.oneapi.io/event-sessions/experience-in-moving-cuda-optimized-fun3d-kernels-to-intel-gpus-using-intel-oneapi/">experiences of porting jet propulsion simulation code</a> using CUDA optimized kernels to
SYCL. Ericâ€™s presentation highlights crucial details of how to migrate this
type of code to target Intel GPUs using SYCL, covering topics including memory
access patterns and optimization techniques.</p>
<p>Ravil Dorozhinskii from the Technical University of Munich <a href="https://www.oneapi.io/event-sessions/performance-portability-and-evaluation-of-heterogeneous-components-of-seisol-targeted-to-upcoming-intel-hpc-gpus/">talked</a> about
the experience of shifting their mindset from CPU programming to GPU
programming. They also shared their experiences of using oneAPI for CUDA for
earthquake simulation, with some promising performance results. </p>
<p>All the sessions are <a href="https://www.oneapi.io/events/oneapi-developer-summit-at-sc">now available on demand</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from the oneAPI Developer Summit on the first day there were
numerous workshops worth keeping an eye on. </p>
<p>Tom Deakin from the University of Bristol regularly presents on
performance portability and has written multiple papers over the years sharing
results comparing models including OpenCL, SYCL and OpenMP. This year at SC21
during the HiPar workshop <a href="https://www.hipar.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ws_hipar21_104s4.pdf">he explained ideas for expanding Hierarchical Parallelism in SYCL</a> and
showed benchmark results using these experimental techniques. This could be an
interesting addition to the SYCL standard in the future for more effective use
of parallelism.</p>
<p>At WACCPD Vincent Pascuzzi also <a href="https://waccpd.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ws_waccpd106s3-file5.pdf">presented his research</a> in accelerating simulations as part of his
research using data from the Large Hadron Collider which is fascinating and
demonstrated that performance portability across processor architectures is
very possible.</p>
<p>The last thing I will mention is the SYCL Birds of a Feather which had a
large and interactive audience of both online and in person participants with
some excellent debates and questions on a range of topics. If you registered
for SC21 and missed it, you should definitely watch the recording through the event
website.</p>
<p>We move on to Christmas and then 2022 when we expect to be talking about
lots of activities at conferences and workshops throughout the year. Let us
know what events you will be watching out for next year on the usual channels.</p>
