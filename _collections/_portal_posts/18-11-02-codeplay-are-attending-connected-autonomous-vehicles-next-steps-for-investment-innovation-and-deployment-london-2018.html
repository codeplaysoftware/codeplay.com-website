<p>“<em>the objective is to have ‘fully driverless cars’ without a safety attendant on board in use by 2021. Some would say that's a bold move, but we have to embrace these technologies if we want the UK to lead the next industrial revolution</em>" Chancellor Phillip Hammond.  Almost a year on from the Government’s response to the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee report into autonomous vehicles this half-day forum will bring together key stakeholders from across the automotive, infrastructure and engineering sectors to analyse the challenges and opportunities ahead.
