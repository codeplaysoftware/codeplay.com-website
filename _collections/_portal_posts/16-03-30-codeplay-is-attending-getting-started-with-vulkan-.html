<p>Codeplay will be attending <a href="http://www.meetup.com/khronos-uk-chapter/events/229489540/">Getting Started with Vulkan</a> at Imperial College London on Wednesday, 6 April.
</p>
<p>
The event is about Vulkan™  - the new graphics &amp; compute API from Khronos™. Vulkan is a new generation graphics and compute API that provides high-efficiency, cross-platform access to modern GPUs used in a wide variety of devices from PCs and consoles to mobile phones and embedded platforms. Khronos launched the Vulkan 1.0 specification on February 16th, 2016 and Khronos members released Vulkan drivers and SDKs on the same day. Further details can be can be found at <a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/">Khronos Group's Vulkan portal</a>.
</p>
<p>
Beginning at 5:30pm in Imperial College's Huxley Building, Lecture Theatre 311, the evening will include opportunities for networking and discussion, as well as talks that provide an overview of what Vulkan is and why it's important, and of course, showing how to get started using it. Further discussion will examine the need for Vulkan, and how it fits alongside the OpenGL™ ES and OpenGL APIs as well as OpenCL™.
