<p>Codeplay will be attending <a href="http://operatingsystems.io/">New Directions in Operating Systems</a> in London on 25th November.

<p>
NDOS is exploring a new stage in innovation in operating systems and in virtualization. The conference's full schedule reflects a widespread excitement over containers, distributed operating systems, security, and new languages which are being used: Mobile, the internet of things, and cloud are changing the way operating systems are used.

Attending from Codeplay will be Aaron Dron, Sean Jones and Colin Riddell.
