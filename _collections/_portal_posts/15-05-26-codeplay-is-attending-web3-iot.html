<p>Codeplay will be attending <a href="http://www.web3iot.com">WEB3//IOT</a> in Edinburgh on Friday 29 May.
</p>

<p>
WEB3//IOT is a reflection of how the World Wide Web has evolved, towards an incarnation of the World Wide Web as something that has become more 'intelligent'. Many believe the most defining thing to happen to the Web is that it now enables machines to communicate with humans, and machines to communicate with other machines (M2M). Cisco's Internet Business Solutions Group (IBSG) refers to this as the &quot;Internet of Everything&quot;, but it is more commonly referred to the Internet of Things (IoT). It is predicted that 50 billion devices will be connected to the Internet by 2020.

<p>
For the first time in history the IoT will bring domain specialists from two very different worlds together. Hardware specialists such as material scientists, structural engineers, and product designers will increasingly collaborate with software experts such as big data scientists, and software engineers. Disciplines from both sides will come together in order to collaborate on new and exciting IoT-related projects
</p>
<p>
Three of Codeplay Software's engineers, Colin Riley, Aidan Dodds, and Sean Jones will be attending the event.
