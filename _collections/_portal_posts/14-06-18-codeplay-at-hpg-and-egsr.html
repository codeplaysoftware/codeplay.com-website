<p>Codeplay is pleased to announce its attendance at the <a href="http://www.highperformancegraphics.org/2014/">High-Performance Graphics 2014</a> conference  and the <a href="http://egsr2014.liris.cnrs.fr/">25th Eurographics Symposium on Rendering</a>, both of which are taking place next week in Lyon. Luke Iwanski and Ralph Potter have both been conducting research on using heterogeneous systems to provide hardware acceleration of graphics algorithms, and look forward to the opportunity to talk to you about heterogeneous computing and high performance graphics.
