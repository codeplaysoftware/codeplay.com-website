<p>Codeplay will be attending <a href="http://2016.secr.ru"><strong><u>CEE SECR 2016</u></strong></a> which is taking place from 28-29 (30) October, Moscow, Russia. Central and Eastern European Software Engineering Conference in Russia (CEE-SECR) is one of the brightest annual IT events in Russia.  Over the years CEE-SECR has become one of the largest platforms for sharing experience, obtaining knowledge and networking. One of the important conference features is the scope of CEE-SECR . The software development process is considered in all its aspects: technologies, management, education, HR, business.</p>&nbsp;<span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;">Attending from Codeplay will be Michael Wong, VP of Research &amp; Development and Duncan McBain, Staff Software Engineer Developer Relations. Michael will be doing a keynote speech on Saturday 29th October, 11.50am on&nbsp;</span><a href="http://2016.secr.ru/program/invited-speakers/michael-wong" style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><strong>'Massive Parallel Dispatch for Heterogeneous Computing in C++ for Self-Driving Cars'</strong></a><strong style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;"><u></u></strong><span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;">Michael and Duncan will also be carrying out a Master-class on Sunday 30th October 10.00am,  </span><strong style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;"><a href="http://2016.secr.ru/master-classes/heterogeneous-programming-using-computecpp-c17-parallel-stl-and-c-concurrency">'Heterogeneous Programming using ComputeCPP, C++17 Parallel STL and C++ Concurrency'</a></strong><span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;">This class with highlight some of the following:&nbsp;</span>
<p><ul><li><em>start with a basic Hello World-style program that shows how to submit queues in a single task and stream-like object, comparing CPU, SYCL™ and OpenCL™ version</em></li><li><em><span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;">demonstrate how to access data across host and GPUs using buffers and accessors, the importance of life-time, and basic parallel constructs</span><br></em></li><li><em><span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;">use advanced techniques such as aussian blur to handle images, that can lead to computer vision useful for pedestrian detection</span><br></em></li><li><span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;"><em>demonstrate C++17 parallel algorithms using SYCL’s parallelSTL implementation that can dispatch to not just CPU, but heterogeneous devices</em></span><br></li></ul></p>
<p>Along with the hands-on workshop, Michael and Duncan will also deliver lectures that describe SYCL and OpenCL as well as C++ Parallelism and Concurrency Technical Specifications, including C++17’s Parallel STL, C++11 async, futures, atomics, and emerging specifications on continuation-style programming, latches, barriers, atomic shared_ptr, as well as lock-free programming toolkits.</p>
<p>Codeplay is also proud to announce the launch of their <a href="https://www.codeplay.com/products/computesuite/computecpp"><strong><u>ComputeCpp Community Edition Beta, enabling Early Access to the SYCL Open Standard for C++ Acceleration</u></strong></a></p>
