<p>Codeplay will be attending the <a href="http://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/events/annual-conference">Edinburgh Centre for Robotics Annual Conference</a> on Friday 23 October.
</p>
<p>
Robots have the potential to revolutionise the world's economy and society over the next twenty years, working for us, beside us and interacting with us. The robotics and autonomous systems area has been highlighted by the UK Government in 2013 as one the 8 Great Technologies that underpin the UK's Industrial Strategy for jobs and growth. The UK urgently needs graduates with the technical skills and industry awareness to create an innovation pipeline from academic research to global markets, in application areas including manufacturing, assistive and medical robots, offshore energy, environmental monitoring, search and rescue, defence, and support for the ageing population, amounting to a market space worth €15.5 billion globally.
</p>
<p>
A key focus of the Centre is to produce innovation-ready graduates - who can not only make fundamental advances in the theory and development of robotics technology, but also have the skills to take these advances through to achieving impact in the form of new products and new companies.
</p>
<p>
The conference programme includes various talks from prominent speakers, presentations from the 2014 cohort, and a student and industry interactive session.
</p>
<p>
One of Codeplay's engineers, Luke Iwanksi, will be attending this event.
