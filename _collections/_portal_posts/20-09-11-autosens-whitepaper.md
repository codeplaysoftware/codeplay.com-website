Codeplay's Charles Macfarlane, CBO, and Illya Rudkin, Safety-Critical Software Development Lead, have contributed to this white paper as part of the <a href="https://auto-sens.com/" target="_blank">Autosens conference proceedings</a>. The paper emphasizes the need for the automotive industry to embrace open standards including SYCL in order to be able to meet the needs of the next generation of vehicles.

"There is nothing missing today to allow OEMs, Tier 1s,
research, advanced developments and software partners to
start evaluating and developing with SYCL. The ecosystem
is well established, and many organizations are already contributing
their results, open source projects and guidance,
providing the support for anyone to get up and running.
The question is more about timing than the likelihood of
its adoption: when will ADAS software developers transition
to a modern C++ programming style. Many companies
are already demanding OpenCL or SYCL within their requirements
and it is reassuring to see real ambition to compete
with the companies investing heavily in autonomous
vehicles."
