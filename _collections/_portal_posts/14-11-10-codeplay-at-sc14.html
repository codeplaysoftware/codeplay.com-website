<p>Codeplay will be attending <a href="http://sc14.supercomputing.org/">SC14</a> in New Orleans from 16th – 21st November. Spotlighting the most original and fascinating scientific and technical applications from around the world, SC14 will once again bring together the HPC community – an unprecedented array of scientists, engineers, researchers, educators, students, programmers, system administrators, and developers – for an exceptional program of technical papers, tutorials, timely research posters, and Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) sessions.
</p>
<p>
Attending from Codeplay will be Andrew Richards (CEO) and Gordon Brown. On the 17th November, Gordon will be delivering a paper at the <a href="http://llvm-hpc-workshop.github.io/">The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure in HPC</a>
 workshop entitled, '<a href="http://llvm-hpc-workshop.github.io/talks.html#brown">Developing a Shared Source Programming Model Using LLVM and Clang</a>, while on the 18th November, Andrew will be participating in a ‘Birds of a Feather’ event, in a session entitled ‘<a href="http://sc14.supercomputing.org/schedule/event_detail?evid=bof131">LLVM in HPC: Uses and Desires</a>’.
