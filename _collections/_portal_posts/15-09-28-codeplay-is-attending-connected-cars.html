<p>Codeplay will be attending the <a href="http://www.connectedcarseurope.com/Venue.aspx">Connected with Cars</a> event in London on Monday 28 September.
</p>
<p>
In today’s climate, connectivity is king. Creating The Connected Car is changing our lives; aiming to improve driver safety, whilst connecting the vehicle with the outside world to provide an all round better driving experience. But, where is the business model for The Connected Car market? With autonomous driving fast approaching, are consumers ready to accept and engage with this new automotive infrastructure yet?
</p>
<p>
Codeplay's Product Marketing Consultant, Charles MacFarlane, will be attending this event.
