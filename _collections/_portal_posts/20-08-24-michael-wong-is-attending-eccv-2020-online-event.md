This year [ECCV 2020](https://eccv2020.eu), one of the top conferences in computer vision, was to be held in Glasgow, Scotland. Since this is not far from our office in Edinburgh, we were looking forward to attending and meeting computer vision experts from around the world. Unfortunately, like the vast majority of conferences in 2020, it has moved to an online format. Codeplay will still be there virtually though, Michael Wong, our Distinguished Engineer & Industry Leader, is joining the online version of the conference, which is the 16th European Conference on Computer Vision, happening from the 23rd to 28th August 2020.

The ECCV is the top European conference in the image analysis area with workshops and tutorials taking place on the 23rd and the 28th of August. The main conference programme will run from 24th to the 27th August. All content from the online conference will be accessible on demand until 1st June 2021. Michael is looking forward to taking part in the live sessions and interacting with the speakers and attendees.

Full details on the event can be found [here](https://eccv2020.eu/) or check out the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoWKrxNC3QM&feature=emb_logo) to see what the virtual platform will look like when you join ECCV 2020.
