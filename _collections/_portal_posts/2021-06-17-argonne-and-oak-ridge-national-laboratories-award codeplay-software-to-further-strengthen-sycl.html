<p><b>LEMONT, IL, and OAK RIDGE, TN, and EDINBURGH, UK, June 17, 2021</b> - Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) in
    collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), has awarded Codeplay a contract implementing the
    oneAPI DPC++ compiler, an implementation of the SYCL open standard software, to support AMD GPU-based
    high-performance compute (HPC) supercomputers.</p>

<p>The Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) is deploying an exascale supercomputer, Aurora, based on
    Intel GPUs with SYCL being one of the primary programming models. The Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility
    (OLCF) is deploying an exascale supercomputer, Frontier, which features AMD GPUs. Exascale supercomputers
    process 10<sup>18</sup> calculations per second, and will be the highest performance computers in the world today. The
    ALCF and OLCF are DOE Office of Science User Facilities.

<p>Enabling the SYCL open standard on Frontier will provide another common programming model to develop scientific
    applications for heterogeneous compute environments across the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DoE) national
    labs. Portable programming models allow application scientists to leverage existing software assets and
    extend their development capabilities in HPC and AI by providing code portability across multiple
    supercomputing systems.

<p>Exascale supercomputers will be used for scientific research by researchers working in diverse areas
    such as medicine, alternative energy, environment, high-energy and nuclear physics, advanced computing,
    materials science, and chemistry. These systems will help advance science computing in an array of areas
    through convergence of simulation, data science, and machine learning methods.

<p>Codeplay is a software company based in the U.K. that has a long history of developing compilers and
    tools for different hardware architectures. The company has been the lead implementor of SYCL compilers
    and a main contributor to the existing open-source support for multiple compute architectures through the
    DPC++ project. Codeplay provides the broadest support for multiple GPUs and specialized hardware accelerators
    through its work with oneAPI, SYCL and OpenCL™.

<p><a href="https://sycl.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SYCL</a> (pronounced "sickle") is an open standard
    programming model that enables heterogeneous programming
    based on standard ISO C++. Heterogeneous programming is the basis for today’s growing HPC, AI, and machine
    learning applications.  SYCL has been gaining momentum as supercomputing communities look for a
    non-proprietary programming model. Maintained under the
    <a href="https://www.khronos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khronos® Group</a> and initially released in 2014,
    SYCL is a royalty-free, cross-platform open standard abstraction layer that enables code for heterogeneous
    processors to be written with the host and kernel code for an application contained in the same source
    file. SYCL has been closely aligned to OpenCL, but over time has evolved into its own completely distinct
    programming model. The latest revision SYCL 2020 can decouple completely from OpenCL and therefore eases
    deployment support on multiple backends.

<p>"Pursuing scientific discoveries on the very fastest architectures should not be limited by closed,
    proprietary software programming models. Having a common open standard is the most efficient path to
    enabling performance portability across DoE’s next-generation supercomputers," said Kevin Harms, ALCF
    Performance Engineering Team Lead.  "We want to make our capabilities accessible to all researchers –
    using DPC++ supporting SYCL does that."

<p>"Being able to write software on one system without concerns for re-writing it for another is important
    to many of our users," said David Bernholdt, Distinguished R&D Staff member at ORNL and lead for the
    Programming Environment and Tools team in the OLCF. "We will be able to collaborate so much more easily
    across the entire Department of Energy. This collaboration will help boost productivity and enable us to
    quickly extend our capabilities to others."

<p>"We see the growing support for different compute architectures through SYCL and open standards software
    for accelerated systems into the HPC community" said Andrew Richards, founder and CEO of Codeplay Software.
    "The SYCL ecosystem exists with developers already benefiting from the wealth of knowledge, experience and
    available libraries. Codeplay is committed to open standards and we feel privileged helping ANL, ORNL and
    the DoE to accelerate their research."
