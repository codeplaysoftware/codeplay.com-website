<p>Codeplay will be attending the <a href="http://www.cambridgewireless.co.uk/events/article/default.aspx?objid=48262">Cambridge Wireless event 'Delivering Big Data: Practical solutions with an emphasis on open source'</a> in London 23 April.
</p>

<p>
The explosion of Big Data solutions is having an impact on the number and variety of technologies developed to deal with gathering, storing, processing and sharing data. The third Big Data SIG event will focus on technological choices for creating Big Data solutions, with a particular emphasis on open source. Taking place in one of the world most recognisable buildings – The Shard, kindly hosted by Mathys &amp; Squire, this timely half-day event will be exploring available open source solutions, provide insight into reasons behind selecting certain technologies over others and present real-world experiences of exploiting open source for Big Data applications. Talks will be heard from Mary-Ann Claridge of Mandrel Systems, Dan Taylor of JDSU, Miika Ahdesmaki of AstraZeneca and Dana Pavel of TecVis.

Codeplay Software's own Product Marketing Consultant, Charles Macfarlane, will be attending this event.
