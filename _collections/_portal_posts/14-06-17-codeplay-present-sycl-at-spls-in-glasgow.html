<p>Andrew Richards, Paul Keir and Lukas Kuklinek of Codeplay will attend the summer meeting of the SICSA-sponsored SPLS on Wednesday 18th June. Andrew will present an overview of the upcoming Khronos SYCL standard. Here is the abstract of his talk:

<p>
<strong>The New SYCL for OpenCL Standard: C++ Metaprogramming for Heterogeneous Systems</strong>
</p>
<p>
Andrew Richards, CEO, Codeplay
</p>
<p>
<em>We have just finished the first provisional release of a standard we have been working on with a group of semiconductor companies and software developers. It's called SYCL and it enables C++ metaprogramming on a wide range of heterogeneous processors supported by OpenCL. This talk will cover some of the problems standardizing a programming model on a range of heterogeneous devices and operating systems and how as a group we overcame those problems with SYCL. We came up with some interesting new solutions to the challenges posed by heterogeneous systems, such as:</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>How do you provide a standard way for different compilers for very different devices to interoperate and compile the same integrated source file?</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>How do you expose the multiple levels of parallelism that exist in OpenCL's execution model in an easy-to-use way?</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>How do you handle the differences in data access between the &quot;host&quot; CPU and different devices in the system?</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>How does the type system handle the difference in pointer types between host and device?</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>We also had a lot of discussions about asynchronous error-handling, which is a hard problem in C++ right now.</em>
</p>
