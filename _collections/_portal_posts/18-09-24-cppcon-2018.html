<p>Codeplay are pleased to announce that <strong> <strong>Michael Wong, VP Research &amp; Development, Gordon Brown, Senior Software Engineer, SYCL &amp; C++, Christopher Di Bella, Staff Software Engineer, ComputeCpp Runtime
    </strong>, and Morris Hafner, Software Engineer, ComputeCpp, </strong>will be at this year's CppCon in Bellevue, Washington from 23rd to 29th September 2018. We are always delighted to speak with anyone attending the event who is interested in what we are doing, so if you are attending, please come and say <strong>“hello”.</strong> If you are interested and would like to arrange a meeting with us at the event, please use our <a href="https://www.codeplay.com/support/contact/">contact form</a> or follow us on <strong>

  </strong> and make contact.<strong>  </strong>
</p>

<p>CppCon is the largest C++ conference in the world and one that Codeplay has supported for a number of years by being part of the Programme Committee as well as delivering presentations on a range of topics. It's a whole week of inspirational talks and classes giving C++ developers a unique opportunity to meet members of the C++ community from across the world and get involved in some great discussions on the nitty gritty of the language. You'll find lots of passionate engineers there who you can learn from,and build long lasting professional and personal friendships. The conference also includes a "Lighting Talks" and "Open Content" sessions ranging from 30-90 minutes giving everyone who attends the chance to deliver a talk on C++ related topics. This is a great opportunity, particularly if you are making a talk for the first time, or if you want to share knowledge you have only recently obtained.</p>

<p>We encourage our team to talk at CppCon because it offers some unique opportunities:</p>

<ul>
<li>We can share our knowledge with the C++ community</li>
<li>We talk with, and learn from, community members with similar interests</li>
<li>It gives us a chance to learn and see different perspectives from your audience</li>
</ul>


<p>In the past we've made a bunch of talks at CppCon and here are some videos from the past couple of years:</p>

<h3>CppCon 2018 Codeplay Presentations</h3>

<p>This year we are represented in five sessions at CppCon covering a range of topics:</p>

<p>If you want to learn how to write accelerated applications using C++, <strong>Gordon Brown</strong> and <strong>Michael Wong</strong> are presenting on <a href="http://sched.co/FnL9">Programming Models for GPUs using SYCL
  </a>.</p>

<p>Find out how you can help your colleagues become better engineers by attending <strong>Christopher Di Bella</strong>'s talk about his <a href="http://sched.co/FnKy">experiences in teaching C++.</a>
</p>

<p>The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, or UEFI was introduced to replace BIOS as a high-level interface between hardware and the kernel, <strong>Morris Hafner</strong> is talking about <span>
    <a href="http://sched.co/FnKe">bringing modern C++ to UEFI applications and other more "constrained" environments</a> that can only support the freestanding subset of C++. </span>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Michael Wong</strong> is also participating in two panel sessions covering <a href="https://cppcon2018.sched.com/event/FqX8">safe reclamation in high performance computing</a> and <a href="https://cppcon2018.sched.com/event/GC18">code optimization.</a>
</p>

<br>
<h3>C++Weekend Classes</h3>

<p>For the first time we are also running two classes at CppCon. These are two day courses designed to give attendees a deep dive into specific C++ topics.</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://cppcon2018.sched.com/event/Fmfi/parallel-programming-with-modern-c-from-cpu-to-gpu">Parallel Programming with Modern C++: From CPU to GPU</a> with Gordon Brown (Staff Software Engineer at Codeplay) and Michael Wong (VP Research &amp; Development at Codeplay, SYCL Working Group Chair and Canadian Head of Delegation to the ISO C++ Standard)</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://cppcon2018.sched.com/event/Fmfh/generic-programming-20-with-concepts-and-ranges">Generic Programming 2.0 with Concepts and Ranges</a> with Christopher Di Bella (Staff Software Engineer at Codeplay)</p>

<p>You don't need to attend CppCon to sign up for <a href="https://cppcon.org/classes-2018/"> these classes </a> as they are separate from the main conference ticket, and you can book your place <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cppcon-2018-registration-38781666007">through CppCon here</a>.</p>
