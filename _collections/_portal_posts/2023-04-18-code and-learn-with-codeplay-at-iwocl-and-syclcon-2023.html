<p>We are excited to be able to participate in person at this year’s IWOCL & SYCLcon conference. This is the first in
    person edition of this conference for more than 3 years and we can’t wait to have some in depth conversations with
    other members of the OpenCL&trade; and SYCL&trade; developer communities.</p>

<p>In fact, we are so excited to be able to meet in person we have teamed up with the University of Cambridge to host a
    SYCL hackathon on Monday 17th April, the same week as IWOCL. You can register for this
    <a href="https://cosmos-ctc-cambridge.github.io/sycl-hackathon/" target="_blank">on the website</a>. We'll be
    working in teams to help improve SYCL benchmarks for multiple platforms. It’s also a chance to get your hands on the
    latest Intel Data Center GPU Max 1100 (aka Ponte Vecchio).</p>

<p>This year the conference program is again dominated by SYCL material with more than 24 SYCL themed sessions covering
    a broad range of topics. If you are a novice or more experienced SYCL developer you can join the tutorials on
    Tuesday 18th and there are presentations on Wednesday and Thursday covering both SYCL specification proposals
    alongside real world research and use.</p>

<h2>Monday 17th April</h2>

<p>Join the <a href="https://cosmos-ctc-cambridge.github.io/sycl-hackathon/"
               target="_blank">SYCL Practitioner Hackathon</a> organised by the University of Cambridge to
    help evolve a set of benchmarks for SYCL. This is a great opportunity to share your own knowledge but also learn
    about SYCL 2020 features, developing consistent and standard benchmarks, and optimizing SYCL code for
    different architectures.</p>

<h2>Tuesday 18th April</h2>

<p>There are two SYCL tutorials happening on this day. One is focused on developers who have not used SYCL before and
    introduces the main concepts and paradigms. The other is focused on more advanced topics for developers who are
    already using SYCL. Take your pick from these great opportunities for in person learning with some of the world’s
    SYCL experts.</p>

<h2>Wednesday 19th April</h2>

<p>This is the first day of the conference and the annual State of the Union for SYCL is the keynote presentation where
    you can find out what the standards group has been working on, what is happening in the SYCL community, and what the
    future holds for the specification. Following the keynote there are lots of great presentations, including the real
    world experiences of migrating molecular docking research from CUDA to SYCL, bringing SYCL code to edge devices such
    as the NVIDIA Jetson, and how SYCL will be adopted in safety critical systems. There is also a panel session focused
    on the hot topic of machine learning, and how SYCL and OpenCL are helping to accelerate the development of the next
    generation of AI applications.</p>

<h2>Thursday 20th April</h2>

<p>The final day of the conference starts with something that is looking to the next generation of supercomputers,
    zettascale, and Paul Calleja will tell us more about the UK lab exploring how to reach this performance target.
    Following this there is another packed day of content, with presentations on science projects like GROMACS and
    physics project PANDA alongside sessions covering broader topics.</p>

<p>As always alongside the presentations there is a full poster program covering fascinating topics. We are very curious
    to hear about a CAD tool for SYCL programming and also finding out “what’s new for numerical astrophysics in SYCL
    2020.</p>

<p>Take a look at the full program to see the depth of content, register today and come and meet the Codeplay team at
    IWOCL and SYCLcon 2023. If you want to make sure you catch us get in touch via
