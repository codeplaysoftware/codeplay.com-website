<p><em>ACCU conferences have a long tradition of high quality sessions covering many technical aspects of software development. ACCU conferences are strong in sessions on aspects of programming languages such as C++, Java, C# and Python for all levels of experience. The conferences also include sessions about the wider development environment beyond languages such as development process, design, patterns and softer aspects such as team building, communication and leadership.</em></p>
<p><em>ACCU conferences present a world class line-up of speakers including many well known industry figures, writers and practicing developers from the front line of software development. Keynote speakers in recent years have included Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of the C++ language, Guido van Rossum, creator of the Python Language, Eric Raymond of open source software fame, security expert Ross Anderson and software guru Jim Coplien.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>ACCU conferences are a great place for developers, analysts, planners and managers who care about programming to engage in dialogue, share experiences and learn from experts. </em><strong><em>More on ACCU and the conference can be found here: <a href="https://conference.accu.org/site/stories/2017/presenters.html"><u>ACCU</u></a></em></strong></p>
