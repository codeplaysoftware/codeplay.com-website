<p>The AMD™ CodeXL™ project brought a number of capabilities to developers who are developing for AMD GPUs and CPUs. These enable developers to profile their code to visualize performance and understand execution sequences.</p>
<p>We have been working as part of the LPGPU2 project to expand the capabilities of the CodeXL project to support SYCL™ applications, and we've reached a key milestone. The teams at Codeplay are using CodeXL to ease their development and identify ways to improve their code, and soon it will be available to all SYCL developers.</p>
