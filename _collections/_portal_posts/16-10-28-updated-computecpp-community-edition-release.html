<p>We are pleased to announce a new release of ComputeCpp™ Community Edition. Version 0.1.1 is a minor release featuring both compiler and runtime bug fixes, in response to user feedback.</p>
<p>Bugs fixed:
</p><ul>
  <li>Compiler: Fixed data members being referenced before declaration in classes.</li>
  <li>Compiler: The compiler front-end now bans C-style variadic function calls inside kernels, as mandated by the SYCL 1.2 specification.</li>
  <li>SYCL_DEVICE_ONLY macro is now defined by the compiler, not the runtime headers.</li>
  <li>Runtime: Allow OpenCL runtime to choose appropriate work-group size when not user-specified in parallel_for call.</li>
</ul>
