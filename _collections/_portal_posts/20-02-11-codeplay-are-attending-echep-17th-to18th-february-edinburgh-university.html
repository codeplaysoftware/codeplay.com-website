<p>Peter Žužek, Senior Software Engineer SYCL, will be presenting at the Efficient Computing for High Energy Physics workshop on the 17th and 18th February at the Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics at the University of Edinburgh. His talk will cover an introduction to SYCL and the range of frameworks available to SYCL developers. As a model, SYCL enables physicists to write highly performant software that can be run on a broad range of HPC architectures.</p>

<p>The Efficient Computing for High Energy Physics (ECHEP) project is funded by STFC's opportunities call. The aim of the project is to enable the UK HEP community to contribute to harnessing modern computing architectures and improve software and computing efficiency. This will directly address the HL-LHC computing problem.</p>

<p>The workshop will bring together interested members of the UK community and international experts with the following aims:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Inform the community on alternative architectures (industry representatives)</li>
  <li>Discuss the challenges of the HEP software stack</li>
  <li>Discuss work already done to address this, within the UK and internationally</li>
  <li>Identify proof-of-principle demonstrations of new platforms</li>
  <li>Form a new community of experts in the UK, with international engagement</li>
  <li>Establish working parties with defined deliverables and reporting structure</li>
  <li>Discuss preparation of an SoI to STFC's Science Board with the PI of the planned SoI to STFC: Professor Davide Costanzo (University of Sheffield)</li>
</ul>

<p>Following this workshop and the second workshop six months later, a detailed plan and impact strategy for a subsequent three-year R&amp;D project will be written that will provide a basis for parts of the anticipated STFC project proposal, if the SoI, led by Davide Costanzo, is approved.</p>

<p>The workshop will run from 9am on 17th February until 5pm on 18th February.  The workshop is funded by STFC's opportunities call and by the Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics in Edinburgh.</p>
