An AI supported car recognizes its surroundings and evaluates the implications for its „behaviour“. The expectations are high: Detection and recognition of multiple objects, improved perception, reduced power consumption, improved object classification, recognition and prediction of actions, and finally, also a reduction of  development time of ADAS systems.</em></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>&nbsp;In fact, analysts forecast a huge rise in attach rate numbers for AI based systems in new vehicles by 2025, they see a variety of AI systems installed in many cars. But what can we really expect from AI in cars? Is it really the key milestone for autonomous cars or just the next hype? The conference Cognitive Vehicles has been set up to discuss potential use cases, advantages of AI compared to traditional algorithms. When discussing the potential of AI an overview of the latest advances in sensor and perception technology is a must. Get insights into environmental models and sensor fusion concept'.
