<p>Is Current Research on Heterogeneous HPC Platforms inline with Real-world Application needs? Codeplay’s Paul Keir will join a discussion panel in Barcelona next week, to field this and similar questions. The panel forms part of a 2-slot thematic session organised as part of <a href="http://www.hipeac.net/csw/2014/barcelona">HiPEAC’s Computing Systems Week</a> (CSW). The session is on Thursday 15 May in the morning from 9:00 to 12:30. There will be two presentations in the earlier morning session from 9:00 to 10:30; with the panel session in the later session from 11:00 to 12:30. See <a href="http://hipeac.net/add/res/102/467">http://hipeac.net/add/res/102/467</a> for further details.
