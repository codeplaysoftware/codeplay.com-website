<p>Two of Codeplay's finest Research Engineers will attend the <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~dsg/events/ISS-AiPL-2014/">2nd International Summer School on Advances in Programming Languages</a>, which will take place during 19 - 22 August, at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh.
</p>
<p>
The event offers four days of insightful lectures and lab sessions, on an engaging blend of cutting-edge theoretical and practical techniques, delivered by international experts. The topics include type systems and dependent types, novel programming models, and domain-specific languages, among others. The School is primarily intended for postgraduate research students and aims to foster international collaboration, and encourage a dialogue among early career researchers and renowned scientists.

<p>
Representing Codeplay, Software Engineer Lukas Kuklinek will be attending on Wednesday 20th August; while Codeplay's Head of Research, Paul Keir, will attend on the Thursday. We are very excited to hear about recent advances in programming language theory and related research. Please stop by and have a wee chat with us, be it related to programming languages and compilers or not!</p>
