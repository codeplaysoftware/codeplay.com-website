The challenge for software developers is that they are currently constrained by proprietary programming models, and this is stifling the choices they can make about their hardware platforms.  Developers today are often locked into Nvidia GPUs because their software uses a proprietary programming model called CUDA, and it’s time to build an open alternative. The oneAPI project has been created to bring together an open specification and open source software that today enables developers to write software using standard C++ code and deploy to multiple vendors of GPUs. This project is evolving rapidly and the whole community of hardware and software developers are invited to contribute to this project.  This presentation will introduce how it is possible to write multi-target software using the oneAPI project, and how everyone can contribute to making this project available for all accelerators in the future.<br/></p>
