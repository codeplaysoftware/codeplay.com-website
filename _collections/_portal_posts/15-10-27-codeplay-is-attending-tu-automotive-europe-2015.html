<p>Codeplay will be attending <a href="http://www.tu-auto.com/europe/conference-agenda.php">TU-Automotive Europe 2015</a>, 2-3 November in Stuttgart, Germany.
</p>
<p>
TU-Automotive Europe (formerly Telematics Munich) is Europe's largest conference &amp; exhibition dedicated to the future of auto mobility.
</p>
<p>
For 13 years, this event has grown enormously in size, scope and significance – totally reflecting the path that the connected car has taken from ‘concept’ to ‘reality’. To reflect how the future of the car is not only being defined by in-car connectivity, two new areas of focus have been added to the conference - new models of auto mobility and automated driving technology.
</p>
<p>
Codeplay's Product Marketing Consultant, Charles MacFarlane, will be attending this event.
