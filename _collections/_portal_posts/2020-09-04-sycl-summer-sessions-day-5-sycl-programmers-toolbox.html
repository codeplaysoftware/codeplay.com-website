<p><b>SYCL Programmer's Toolbox: Tips & Tricks for Effective Application Development</b></p>
<p><b>Presenter: Philip Salzmann, University of Innsbruck</b></p>

<p>To many, programming highly parallel architectures still seems like a daunting task, as low-level APIs and limited tooling support have historically resulted in a developer experience that leaves much to be desired. However, great strides have been made in recent years, with modern programming models such as SYCL alleviating most of these pains. In particular, SYCL developers may benefit from its modern API design, flexible execution model as well as robust tooling support for underlying hardware platforms â€“ if they know how to take advantage of it. This talk, aimed at beginners and intermediate SYCL users, will take a look at a variety of useful tips, tricks and techniques that may come in handy during SYCL application development.</p>
