<p>Develop using the open, standards-based SYCL&trade; programming model for multiple accelerators with oneAPI.</p>

<p><b>[Dec. 16, 2022 - Edinburgh, UK]</b> – Today, Codeplay Software announces expanding oneAPI for Nvidia* and AMD*
    GPUs, making multiarchitecture, multivendor programming much easier. This includes new plugins: oneAPI
    for Nvidia GPUs and oneAPI for AMD GPUs (beta).</p>

<p>Software developers are increasingly looking to move away from proprietary interfaces and use open standards
    that are defined by the industry. This can allow them to target a broad set of platforms and architectures.
    oneAPI aims to bring this to reality by supporting the widest set of processors and accelerators. As a
    cross-industry initiative, <a href="https://www.oneapi.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oneAPI</a>
    offers an open, standards-based, multiarchitecture programming model and
    <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-spec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specification</a>.</p>

<p>Having official plugins for Nvidia and AMD platforms is a major milestone for the oneAPI open community.
    The oneAPI Nvidia and AMD GPU plugins seamlessly work with the Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler 2023
    and many popular libraries, bringing open, standards-based programming to a range of processors from
    multiple hardware vendors. The oneAPI for Nvidia GPUs and oneAPI for AMD GPUs packages are available
    to download for free on the <a href="https://developer.codeplay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        Codeplay website</a>.</p>

<p>The plugins are compatible with the tools and drivers provided by Nvidia and AMD. A major benefit of this
    release is bringing a truly viable migration path from CUDA and other proprietary programming models to
    SYCL and oneAPI. To ease this porting, oneAPI already includes SYCLomatic, an open source tool to help
    migrate CUDA code to SYCL. Using the oneAPI for Nvidia GPU plugin, this SYCL code can be run on NVIDIA GPUs.</p>

<p>Together with the plugin for Nvidia GPUs, Codeplay is providing paid-for enterprise-ready “Priority Support”
    for customers who want quick answers to technical problems and general support for their oneAPI deployments
    on Nvidia platforms. This will enable developers to get accelerated responses directly from Codeplay
    engineers and escalate feature requests to Codeplay’s development team for exploration.</p>
