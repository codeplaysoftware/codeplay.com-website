<p>Codeplay will be attending the <a href="https://www.hipeac.net">HiPEAC 2016 conference</a>, 18-20 January in Prague, Czech Republic.
</p>
<p>
The HiPEAC conference is the premier European forum for experts in computer architecture, programming models, compilers and operating systems for embedded and general-purpose systems. Associated workshops, tutorials, special sessions, several large poster sessions and an industrial exhibition will run in parallel with the conference. The three day event attracts about 500 delegates each year.
</p>
<p>
On Monday 18 January, Codeplay are giving a <a href="https://www.hipeac.net/events/activities/7328/sycl/">tutorial</a> on The Khronos™ Group's SYCL™ open standard for C++ with OpenCL™, in conjunction with key members of the SYCL community. This half-day tutorial will provide an opportunity to learn about the latest developments in SYCL from leading members of the SYCL working group within Khronos. Tutorial speakers include several working group members that are actively involved in writing the SYCL specification, and engineers from two separate SYCL implementations.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://lpgpu.org/wp/">LPGPU2</a> H2020 project will also be continuing its annual <a href="http://lpgpu.org/wp/pegpum-2016/">PEGPUM</a> workshop during the afternoon of Wednesday 20 January. From Codeplay, Mehdi Goli will be talking about a SYCL-based computer vision library that provides an abstract model to allow programmers to develop vision applications independently from the underlying architecture.
</p>
<p>
As well as our own CEO, Andrew Richards, several of Codeplay's engineers, Alastair Murray, Ruyman Reyes, Victor Lomuller, Meenakshi Ravindran, Luke Iwanski, Mehdi Goli and Antonio Vilches (a former HiPEAC intern at Codeplay), will be attending this event.
