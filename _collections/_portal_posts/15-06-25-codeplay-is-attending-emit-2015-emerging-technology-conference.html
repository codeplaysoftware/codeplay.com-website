<p>Codeplay will be attending <a href="http://emit.manchester.ac.uk">EMiT 2015: Emerging Technology Conference</a> in Manchester, 30 June - 1 July.

<p>
The EMiT (EMerging Technology) conference series brings together experts from all areas of computing to examine how to best take advantage of the changing landscape of computer hardware and overcome research barriers for fields such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), computational mechanics, life sciences, and financial modelling.  Building on the success of EMiT 2014 at the University of Manchester, EMiT 2015 is expanding to a 2-day event.
</p>
<p>
With device-independent compilers and high-level languages, to low power and energy efficient computing being applied to ever changing hardware and numerical algorithms for industrial and academic use, EMiT brings all they key organisations and developers together.
