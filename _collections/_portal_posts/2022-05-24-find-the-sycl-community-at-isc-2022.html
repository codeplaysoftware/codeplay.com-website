<br><p><a href="https://www.isc-hpc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISC22,
May 29th – June 2nd 2022, Hamburg, Germany</a>.</p>
<p>The International Supercomputing Conference
(ISC) is back in Germany, and this will be the first time the European HPC
community has been able to meet here face-to-face for more than 2 years. </p>
<p>This is an exciting opportunity for the
SYCL community to meet and discuss.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.oneapi.io/events/oneapi-developer-summit-at-isc-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oneAPI
DevSummit</a> kicks off as a pre-ISC online event on Friday 27th May
with a schedule of what I expect to be insightful topics. Codeplay’s Joe Todd
will be presenting on migrating from CUDA to SYCL, explaining how he ported a
nbody simulation from CUDA to SYCL, whilst continuing to target Nvidia GPUs and
retaining performance. Later in the schedule I will be hosting a panel session
on SYCL Best Practices. If you are new to SYCL development, and even if you are
an experienced SYCL developer you’ll learn something important from this group
of experts. <a href="https://www.oneapi.io/events/oneapi-developer-summit-at-isc-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Registration
is free</a> and separate from ISC.</p>
<p>There is a SYCL tutorial at ISC, which is
the first opportunity we have had for a long time to teach SYCL in person and
face-to-face. Whilst I have enjoyed being able to reach a worldwide audience
through the online SYCL tutorials during the past couple of years, getting back
to teaching in person is really exciting. Join "Heterogeneous Programming in
Modern C++ with SYCL” on Sunday 29th May with a well respected group
of tutors including Peter Zuzek, Principal Engineer at Codeplay and SYCL
Working Group member. This tutorial covers some great introductory topics and
throws in a case study using an image convolution to give you a feel for some
real code. </p>
<p>On Monday 30th May there is a
Birds Of a Feather (BoF) session dedicated to SYCL led by some key members of
the SYCL Working group including James Brodman from Intel, Aksel Alpay from the
University of Heidelberg and Tom Deakin from the University of Bristol. If you
have not attended a BoF before be prepared for discussion during an interactive
session where you can field your questions to the many experts in attendance.
The floor is genuinely open so get involved.</p>
<p>On the final day of ISC22, Thursday 2nd
June, the <a href="https://sycl.tech/events/22/03/31/portable-heterogeneous-programming-with-sycl.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Portable
Heterogeneous with SYCL" workshop</a> is being hosted by my colleague,
Distinguished Engineer and SYCL Working Group chair Michael Wong, in my absence
alongside Aleksander Ilic and Raja Appuswamy. You’ll hear talks on some key
topics, and I’ll now touch on what to expect. Tobias Weinzierl will deliver the
keynote presentation, going into detail of how they are using SYCL to implement
a complex equation system solver. Following that there will be more in-depth
topics:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A talk from Sameer Shende who
is part of the US Exascale Computing Project working on the Extreme-scale
Scientific Software Stack.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Szilard Pall, who has worked on
accelerating the popular GROMACS project, will talk about how SYCL is central
to their plans for supporting current and future target processors.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Matrix-free solvers are part of
Igor Baratta’s research and he will reveal how these can be implemented using
SYCL.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My colleague Peter Zuzek and
team have been working on improving the performance of the ComputeCpp SYCL
implementation, and he will present how using Address Space Inference brought
significant benefits for SYCL developers.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A crucial part of SYCL is the
ability to develop extensions, and often these are used to demonstrate the next
generation of SYCL features, Igor Vorobtsov will talk about some of the
available extensions.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to learn at ISC and some
great opportunities to engage and discuss with the community. <a href="https://www.isc-hpc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Register on the website</a> and join the largest
HPC conference in Europe.</p>
