<p>Codeplay, a long term contributor to OpenCL™ and the Khronos™ Group, is proudly attending the International Workshop on OpenCL (IWOCL) 2014, on the 12th &amp; 13th of May 2014 at the lovely Bristol University in the United Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
We are sending four of our finest to the conference – two of whom are presenting during the jam-packed conference schedule.

<strong>12:40-13:00 – Tuesday, 13th May</strong>
</p>
<p>
At our first presentation of the day, Codeplay’s Technology Lead Neil Henning will take you through the basics of the OpenCL <a href="http://www.khronos.org/spir">Standard Portable Intermediate Representation</a> (SPIR™) specification, the tools that are currently in the wild to utilize this technology, and some of the many awesome benefits that this standard can bring for developers.
</p>
<p>
This presentation will be a bedrock for developers wanting to port other languages to use SPIR, how to build tools that can use it, and where the specification will be heading in the coming years.

<strong>17:40-18:00 – Tuesday, 13th May</strong>
</p>
<p>
Rounding out the conference, Codeplay’s Product Development Lead of R&amp;D Maria Rovatsou will present the recently announced <a href="http://www.khronos.org/opencl/sycl">SYCL™</a> specification from Khronos. We have been involved in this specification from its inception – and it is great to finally be able to present the ins and outs of how an application developer can leverage the power SYCL provides.
