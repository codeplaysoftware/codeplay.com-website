<p>Codeplay will be attending the <a href="http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/UKMAC2016/">2016 UK Many-Core Developer Conference</a> at University of Edinburgh's School of Informatics on 10 May.
</p>
<p>
The UK Many-Core Computing Conference is an informal day of talks spanning the whole landscape of accelerated, heterogeneous and many-core computing. Topics of interest include high-performance computing, embedded and mobile systems, computational science, finance, computer vision and beyond. The goal of the event is to develop and bring together the UK community of developers, both industrial and academic.
</p>
<p>
Codeplay's CEO, Andrew Richards, is providing the day's keynote address, &quot;The Challenges of Delivering Massive Parallelism to Real-World Software&quot;. Andrew's talk considers the huge theoretical potential of massive parallelism, and the challenges of delivering this capability in real-world commercial devices. Considering that the biggest markets for massive parallelism now seem to be machine learning and machine vision from tiny cameras to self-driving cars and massive data centres, Andrew will begin the day by asking: How can we deliver research into real products? How do we standardize the platforms? How do we deliver the tools to make this practical? How do we enable innovation?
</p>
<p>
Also, Codeplay Research Associate, Ralph Potter, will give a presentation entitled, &quot;A C++ Programming Model for Heterogeneous System Architecture&quot;, which will detail some of the challenges motivating our work with Heterogeneous System Architecture, going on to show how existing standard C++ code can be utilized unmodified on accelerators.
</p>
<p>
Also attending from Codeplay will be some of our engineers, Jeroen Ketema, Alastair Murray, JinGu Kang, Dean De Leo, and Chris Cummins. We’re always delighted to speak with anyone interested in what we’re doing, so please come and say &quot;hello&quot;.
