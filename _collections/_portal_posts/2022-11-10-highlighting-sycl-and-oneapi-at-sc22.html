While the key theme of the event is around supercomputers, the most powerful processing systems in the world, the topics vary from semiconductors, memory storage, cooling, and ever increasingly, software. Software is where Codeplay gets involved, providing an open standards based platform for portability and performance with industry leaders. Codeplay continues to promote the SYCL programming model as the ideal solution for application developers, especially with oneAPI platform.&nbsp;</p><p>A major topic this year is the oneAPI Community Forum, led by Codeplay. This organization is bringing the developer community together to drive an open standards and open source software ecosystem. Participants contribute to the definition of standard interfaces for commonly used libraries used in HPC and AI applications. Ensure you link with someone from Codeplay to discuss how to join the forum, in particular you can join the reception linked below.&nbsp;</p><p>Join these free social events to meet and chat with the Codeplay team and wider HPC community:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="https://multicore.world/mw23-happy-hours/" target="_blank">Multicore World Happy Hour</a> sponsored by Codeplay, on Sunday 13th November.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.oneapi.io/" target="_blank">oneAPI Community Forum Reception</a>, Monday 14th November.&nbsp;&nbsp; RSVP <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/sQdM4unYSP" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>There is a strong agenda at SC22 as always, with many papers and presentations covering the latest research from the SYCL community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here is a list of the most interesting sessions:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The tutorial “<a href="https://sc22.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=tut109&amp;sess=sess200" target="_blank">Hands-On HPC Application Development Using C++ and SYCL</a>” will introduce SYCL and provide programmers with a solid foundation they can build on to gain mastery of the language.
