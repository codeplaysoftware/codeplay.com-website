title: Codeplay Brings RISC-V Support to the oneAPI Construction Kit
user_id: 931
---


<p>RISC-V is the fast growing, open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) for processors of all types including CPUs and accelerators. These processors can be utilized for a wide variety of applications with vendors such as Codasip, Axelera and many more creating their own RISC-V processors. The European Union, as part of its European Processor Initiative (EPI), is also looking to create their own microprocessor powered by RISC-V. We’ve long pioneered open ecosystems at Codeplay, and as a member of RISC-V International we’ve been involved with the project for several years, helping to evolve the standard through our working group leadership. We know that open, standards-based hardware is an important step to creating a truly open ecosystem.  </p>
<p>But for that to be achieved, we need equally open software, built on top of open hardware – open source, from top to bottom. </p>
<p>That’s where oneAPI and SYCL come in, bringing a mature programming model alongside an open-source and standards-based ecosystem of software libraries for applications of all types, such as oneMKL or oneDNN. Both SYCL  and oneAPI are heterogeneous – meaning you can write code once and deploy it across GPUs without vendor restriction, whether it’s AMD, Intel, NVIDIA or now, RISC-V. </p>
<p>In our latest 4.0 release of the <a href="https://github.com/codeplaysoftware/oneapi-construction-kit" target="_blank">oneAPI Construction Kit</a>, our team introduced RISC-V native host for the first time, for both native on-host and cross-compilation. This feature makes it possible to run code on a CPU and take advantage of the acceleration SYCL provides through data parallelism. This is a significant step to achieving our vision of a fully open hardware and software stack, by allowing RISC-V processor designers to now easily integrate SYCL and the oneAPI ecosystem with their hardware through the oneAPI Construction Kit. It is entirely open-source and free to use – you can get started by <a href="https://github.com/codeplaysoftware/oneapi-construction-kit" target="_blank">visiting the project on GitHub</a>. </p>
<p>We implemented this support as part of our ongoing work as part of the EU-funded <a href="https://www.syclops.org/" target="_blank">SYCLOPS Project</a>. This project, which includes organizations from across Europe including CERN, Codasip, the University of Heidelberg and more, aims to bring together the RISC-V and SYCL standards into a single, portable and performant stack for the first time. </p>
