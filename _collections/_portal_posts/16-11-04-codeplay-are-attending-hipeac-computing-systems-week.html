<p>Codeplay will be attending <strong>HiPEAC Computing Systems Week</strong>, which is being held from the 7th - 9th November at  the O'Callaghan Alexander Hotel in Dublin. Attending from Codeplay will be <strong>Stephen McGroarty, Software Engineer</strong>. Stephen will be giving a talk on November 8th - 16.15 in the Ascot Suite - O'Callaghan Alexander Hotel on <strong><em>"ComputeCpp: enabling Machine Learning on low power devices"</em></strong>. Stephen will be talking about Codeplay's ComputeCpp technology, which we recently released as an Open Beta<a href="https://www.codeplay.com/portal/earlyaccesstothesyclopenstandardforcacceleration"><strong><u>Early Access to the SYCL Open Standard for C++ Acceleration</u></strong></a>. He will also talk about how we're using it to build standard based performance portable Machine Learning and Vision Libraries.</p>
<p>With the Industrial Session and the Industrial Day during the HiPEAC Conference, the HiPEAC Industrial Partner Program (HIPP) during the Autumn HiPEAC Computing Systems Week (CSW) is the event to fill the missing link between the European industry and European academia.</p>
<p>HIPP and the CSW are the perfect opportunity for companies to establish a relation with the European academia on the High Performance Embedded Architecture and Compilers domain. With HIPP companies can:</p>
<p></p><ul><li><span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;">Introduce themselves to the European academia</span><br></li><li><span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;">Be in contact with a wide source for highly qualified human resources (for interships or hiring)</span><br></li><li><span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;">Discuss R&amp;D roadmaps and priorities with main scientific stakeholders</span><br></li><li><span style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;">Prepare future joint projects</span><br></li></ul>
