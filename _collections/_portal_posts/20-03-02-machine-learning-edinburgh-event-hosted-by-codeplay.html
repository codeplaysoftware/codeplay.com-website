<p>The increasing use of machine learning has been the biggest topic in both software and hardware circles during the past few years, and this will continue as it is deployed to a range of products from smart speakers to self-driving cars.</p>

<p>At Codeplay we have a vision to make it easy for developers to be able to write machine learning applications that can be accelerated on a wide range of processors. This is why we began hosting the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Machine-Learning-Edinburgh/">Machine Learning Edinburgh</a> meetup group. We want to provide a forum for everyone in Edinburgh and beyond to be able to learn about the latest techniques in this field.</p>

<p>We are also pleased to publish videos of the talks from our last meetup.</p>
