<p>Codeplay will be attending the annual <strong><em>CGO Conference co-located with PPoPP, HCA &amp; CC</em></strong>  which will be held on the <strong><em>4th-8th February, </em></strong>Hilton Hotel, Austin, Texas. Attending from Codeplay will be <strong><em>Victor Lomuller, Staff Software Engineer, Compilers and Lukas Kuklinek, Staff Software Engineer, Compilers.</em></strong> We are always delighted to speak with anyone attending the event who is interested in what we are doing, so if you are attending, please come and say<strong><em> “hello”.</em></strong> If you are interested and would like to arrange a meeting with us at the event, please use our <a href="https://www.codeplay.com/support/contact/"><strong><em>contact form</em></strong></a> or follow us on <strong><em>@codeplaysoft </em></strong>and make contact!</p>
<p>Whilst at CGO Victor will be giving a talk at the <strong><em>COSMIC workshop</em></strong> on the 5th February.  Between 15.30pm-16.30pm the talk will be on <strong><em>'SYCL: From compilation to execution and beyond':</em></strong></p>
<p><em><b>'Recent initiatives attempt to bring modern C++ applications to heterogeneous devices. SYCL is a single-source C++ programming environment built on top of OpenCL. In the talk, we will present the SYCL programming model and Codeplay's approach to implement it in ComputeCpp'.</b></em></p>
<p><i>The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO) provides a premier venue to bring together researchers and practitioners working at the interface of hardware and software on a wide range of optimization and code generation techniques and related issues. The conference spans the spectrum from purely static to fully dynamic approaches, and from pure software-based methods to specific architectural features and support for code generation and optimization. More information on the conference can be found here: </i><a href="http://cgo.org/cgo2017/"><b><i>CGO 2017</i></b></a></p>
<p>Codeplay is also proud to announce the new release of ComputeCpp CE, enabling, <a href="https://www.codeplay.com/portal/earlyaccesstothesyclopenstandardforcacceleration"><b>Early Access to the SYCL Open Standard for C++ Acceleration</b></a></p>
