<p><b><i>About this Event:</i></b></p>
<p><i>A joint event between the IET Vision and Imaging Network and the Knowledge Transfer Network (KTN). This event is an opportunity to network with and hear presentations from a range of leading companies and academics. Topics under discussion will include imaging hardware to image processing and display and applications, in sectors as diverse as medical, media and aerospace. Imaging is ubiquitous in several sectors including creative media, transport and automation among many others. The UK has been at the forefront of numerous advances in image capture, processing and display and therefore has both academic and commercial expertise from devices to the extraction of useful information from images. The Intelligent Imaging event’s programme has been set up to provide a focus for this community of developers and users, to enable effective knowledge exchange and to provide a means to organisations wishing to collaborate. The programme will showcase the range of UK imaging technology capabilities and experience of application.
