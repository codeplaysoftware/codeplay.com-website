<h3>Codeplay join experts in Denver to provide a keynote talk and join panel sessions discussing the strengths of SYCL for HPC</h3><br><img src="{{ '/assets/images/portal/article-images/01c76ea55f7bd3fa702b9860c1cdafc3.png' | relative_url }}"><br><br>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://sc19.supercomputing.org/">SuperComputing conference</a> is the largest gathering of high performance computing experts in the world, with over 11,000 attendees.</li>
  <li>Each year, SuperComputing provides the leading technical program for professionals and students in the HPC community, as measured by impact, at the highest academic and professional standards.</li>
  <li>The Program is designed to share best practices in areas such as: algorithms; applications; architectures and networks; clouds and distributed computing; data analytics, visualization, and storage; machine learning and HPC; performance; programming systems; system software; and state of the practice in large-scale deployment and integration.</li>
</ul>

<p>While traditionally high performance computing has seen use of interfaces such as FORTRAN, in the past few years there has been a rapidly growing interest in using C++ for HPC applications. In fact, this year at SC19 there are many sessions talking about C++, and more specifically SYCL, with a range of sessions presenting research projects using SYCL, providing a forum for discussion and explaining how to develop using SYCL.</p>

<p>Andrew Richards (CEO), Michael Wong (VP R&amp;D and SYCL WG Chair) and John Lawson (AI Software Expert) from Codeplay will be at SuperComputing 2019 (SC19) in Denver, Colorado and are ready for a packed agenda that includes more SYCL talks than ever before.</p>
<h3>What does the SYCL agenda at SC19 look like?</h3>

<p>
  <span class="presentation-date">The conference kicks off on Sunday 17th November when the </span>
  <a href="https://sc19.supercomputing.org/presentation/?sess=sess110&amp;id=wksp128#038;id=wksp128">Fifth International Workshop on Heterogeneous High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing</a> (H2RC 2019) hosts two presentations focused on SYCL.  The keynote talk is by <a href="https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&amp;p=3478&amp;uid=567773">Ronan Keryell</a> from Xilinx where he outlines the benefits of using SYCL for FPGA programming in a talk entitled "<a href="https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&amp;p=3479&amp;id=pec404&amp;sess=sess110">SYCL: A Single-Source C++ Standard for Heterogeneous Computing</a>." Later in the morning at 11:00am <a href="https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&amp;p=3478&amp;uid=189183">Michael Kinsner</a> and <a href="https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&amp;p=3478&amp;uid=008583">John Freeman</a> from Intel present "<a href="https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&amp;p=3479&amp;id=ws_h2rc111&amp;sess=sess110">Data Flow Pipes: A SYCL Extension for Spatial Architectures"</a> describing the pipes extension that enables a more usable and flexible interface.</p>
<p>Also on Sunday 17th November, Codeplay CEO Andrew Richards will be on stage at <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/hpc-day-with-the-next-platform/">HPC Day with The Next Platform</a> conducting a live interview entitled "Toward an Open Ecosystem for HPC and AI Compute" at 4:20pm.<br></p>

<p>
  <span class="presentation-date">On Monday 18th November things begin with a keynote talk from Codeplay's Michael Wong at the <a href="https://hpc.pnl.gov/IA3/">IA^3 2019 workshop</a>. This is followed later in the day at 4:25pm with a panel "<a href="https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&amp;p=3479&amp;id=pec281&amp;sess=sess127">Convergence, Divergence, or New Approaches? - The Future of Software-Based Abstractions for Heterogeneous Supercomputing</a>" where <a href="https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&amp;p=3478&amp;uid=655753">Fernanda Foertter</a> from NVidia will discuss with panellists </span>
  <a href="https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&amp;p=3478&amp;uid=160653">Jeff R. Hammond (Intel),</a> <a href="https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&amp;p=3478&amp;uid=366263">Jack Deslippe (LBNL),</a> <a href="https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&amp;p=3478&amp;uid=074663">Christian Robert Trott (Sandia National Labs),</a> <a href="https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&amp;p=3478&amp;uid=360573">Michael Wolfe (NVidia)</a> and <a href="https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&amp;p=3478&amp;uid=295583">Johannes Doerfert</a> (ANL) what interfaces are available to developers looking to take advantage of accelerator processors. We expect a heated debate on the advantages of the various options including SYCL.</p>

<p>Also running on the 18th November is Intel's <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/events/intel-supercomputing.html">Breakthrough AI+HPC</a> conference at SC19 where they have organsed a wide range of workshops, tutorials and presentations. SYCL will play a role here too after Intel's announcement of it's OneAPI initiative and DPC++ interface that implements the SYCL standard. You can learn about DPC++ with <a href="https://intel.lineupr.com/sc19/item/dpc-a-technical-overview">a technical overview presentation</a> and if you want to do some SYCL coding, there is a <a href="https://intel.lineupr.com/sc19/item/lab-oneapi-workshop">hands-on-lab.</a> Codeplay CEO Andrew Richards will be presenting at the Intel event, his talk <a href="https://intel.lineupr.com/sc19/item/an-open-ecosystem-for-hpc-developers">An Open Ecosystem for HPC Developers</a> will cover the current SYCL ecosystem from top to bottom.</p>
