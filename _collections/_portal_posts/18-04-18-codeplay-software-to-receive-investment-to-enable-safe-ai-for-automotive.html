<span data-trumbowyg-textnode="">Foresight has committed £2.1M ($3M) into Edinburgh based software company, Codeplay, to grow its world-leading team with safety specialist engineers needed for safe and reliable artificial intelligence in automotive systems.<br><br></span><div><span data-trumbowyg-textnode="">The commitment, of which Foresight Williams Technology EIS Fund has already invested £1.05 million,  will enable Codeplay to extend its ComputeSuite™ products for integration into advanced driver assist systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. This will support C++ software programmers in developing their latest vision and AI algorithms on state-of-the-art specialised AI processors. Codeplay's solution will accelerate development time and provide a safe and verified platform for faster deployment.
</span></div><div><span data-trumbowyg-textnode=""></span></div><div><span data-trumbowyg-textnode="">Last year, Codeplay announced a relationship with Renesas, a leading Japanese semiconductor company, to enable their next generation of advanced automotive processors. Codeplay is already demonstrating complex vision processing applications running on their R-Car products H3, V3M and recently announced&nbsp;V3H.
</span></div><div><span data-trumbowyg-textnode=""></span></div><div><span data-trumbowyg-textnode="">ADAS systems provide surround monitoring around the car features such as adaptive cruise control and collision avoidance, self-parking and driver monitoring. These functions are now common-place&nbsp;and are being adopted into most new cars produced providing extra safety systems and reducing accidents.
</span></div><div><span data-trumbowyg-textnode=""></span></div><div><span data-trumbowyg-textnode="">Since 2002 Codeplay has developed complex software components for gaming consoles, mobile phones and other complex devices. The&nbsp;ComputeSuite&nbsp;products enable software programmers to develop leading-edge applications using well known and understood techniques. Codeplay has already established a global reputation and worked with most of the largest processor companies.&nbsp;
</span></div><div><span data-trumbowyg-textnode=""></span></div><div><span data-trumbowyg-textnode="">Building on their proven expertise in precision engineering, systems integration and optimisation, Williams Advanced Engineering is well-placed to provide support with the development of automotive safety certified products.&nbsp;Foresight’s expertise in growing businesses and expanding them globally will be invaluable.&nbsp;Supporting Codeplay with investment&nbsp;preparation in Edinburgh were Stephen Gibbens of Accountech, Chiene &amp; Tait Accountants and MBM&nbsp;Commercial.
</span></div><div><span data-trumbowyg-textnode=""></span></div><div><span data-trumbowyg-textnode="">“Codeplay is already influencing how AI is enabled with leading processor companies using ComputeSuite” said Andrew Richards, Founder and CEO of Codeplay Software. “With Foresight’s investment and Williams Advanced Engineering support, we will advance our automotive solutions and support the strong growth of ADAS and ultimately the autonomous drive vehicle”.
</span></div><div><span data-trumbowyg-textnode=""></span></div><div><span data-trumbowyg-textnode="">Chris Wardle, Investment Manager, Foresight said “We are very excited to partner with Codeplay, an established leader in heterogenous processor systems and support their expansion into safety-certified Artificial Intelligence products for Automotive as well as other verticals.”&nbsp;</span></div><div><span data-trumbowyg-textnode=""></span></div><div><br/><br/><h3><span data-trumbowyg-textnode="">

Codeplay is a real home-grown, Scottish success story. Codeplay was founded by Andrew Richards and Dr Jens-Uwe Dolinsky. Andrew started his career in the 8-bit days writing games for the ZX Spectrum from home, progressing up to writing large console games on the Sega Megadrive and PlayStation. He then decided he was interested in producing new technology for game developers to enable them to do new things. It was becoming possible to do some interesting new things on the graphics hardware that was being introduced. So he started a company with Uwe (who has a PhD in Robotics) to develop technology to let programmers take software they had written for normal computers and run it on new graphics-capable computers. It seemed like an interesting revolution that was about to happen. That was more than a decade ago and to be honest, it took a bit longer than he expected to happen!&nbsp;
</span></div><div><span data-trumbowyg-textnode=""></span></div><div><span data-trumbowyg-textnode="">Codeplay first operated in 2002 out of a small 2nd floor office in Edinburgh's Hanover St, before rapidly expanding until in 2017 they are proud to announce a staff of 70 in Argyle House, with 2 colleagues working remotely in Toronto and the Isle of Skye. During this period, Codeplay have always tried to maintain their friendly work culture along with the growth in their workforce and market reach. Codeplay is extremely proud of their Silver Accreditation from Investors in People and is actively working towards Gold Accreditation.</span></div><div><span data-trumbowyg-textnode=""></span></div><div><br/><br/><h3><span data-trumbowyg-textnode="">
