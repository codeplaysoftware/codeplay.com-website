<p>Codeplay will be attending the <b>Embedded C++ Conference </b>which is being held on the 18th February at the PROLAB Institute, TH Bochum. Attending from Codeplay will be <b>Michael Wong, VP of Research &amp; Development.</b>  We are always delighted to speak with anyone attending the event who is interested in what we are doing, so if you are attending, please come and say <b>“hello”. </b>If you are interested and would like to arrange a meeting with us at the event, please use our <a href="https://www.codeplay.com/support/contact/"><b>contact form</b></a> or follow us on @codeplaysoft and make contact!</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that Michael will be giving a keynote speech on the 18th February at 09.30am.<b> "What has C++ Standard done for Embedded Programming ... and will it be enough, or just OK?"</b> <i>"C has traditionally provided the basis for Embedded programming but C++ is working hard to catch-up. This is evidenced by the creation of the Embedded Special Interest Group (SIG) within SG14 within C++ Standard, which looks at common issues between Games, Financial, and Embedded community with a special focus on constrained systems, and low-latency. There are needs for both simple translation of C code to C++, and also higher level support for the advanced features of C++ in Embedded programming. As the chair of SG14, this talk will look at some of the latest proposals from C or C++ Standard that supports this direction. Did you know there are already proposals accepted into C++17 that is starting to change the mindset. We will also look at some of the current proposals from SG14 that continues the Embedded train rolling. These include fixed-point, ring span, flat containers, small vector, and other proposals that reduce demand for dynamic memory allocation, or improve static or const usage. We will also look at some of the traditional obstacles that has prevented C++ from being actively used for the embedded community, and a plan of action SG14 has devised to address this weakness using GSL. We hope you can join and help the effort. But you be the judge. Will it be enough or just OK?" </i>More information can be found on the conference here <a href="https://www.embo.io"><b><i>Embedded C++ Conference</i></b></a></p>
