<p>At the <a href="sc21.supercomputing.org/">Supercomputing SC21</a> conference last year there were many research
papers and presentations to help us learn more about how SYCL is being used
across the industry. One of the sessions that stood out for me was presented by
Dr. Vincent Pascuzzi from Brookhaven National Laboratory whose research paper
was co-authored with Mehdi Goli, VP Research at Codeplay<b>®</b>
 and outlined the
collaboration that is being done to advance research using the Large Hadron
Collider. You can find the slides <a href="https://waccpd.org/program/#sycl">on the workshop website</a> and the paper itself is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01329">also now available</a>. I also talked
to Vincent about his work during an online video presentation and chat during
the latest SYCL Session <a href="https://youtu.be/P-sOQmwQ5gI">available on YouTube</a>.</p><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://youtu.be/P-sOQmwQ5gI"><img src="{{ '/assets/images/portal/article-images/2022-02-21_13-15-46.png' | relative_url }}" width="437" height="242"></a></div>
<p>Vincent is a physicist turned Computational Scientist and is working in
conjunction with researchers at CERN who run experiments with the <a href="https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider">Large Hadron Collider (LHC)</a>. As a physicist he is of course very interested in
the results from these experiments. His work focuses on the ATLAS detector, one
of the general purpose experiments stationed along the LHC ring, that is
designed for particle physics research and it is hoped will make physics discoveries
beyond the Standard Model like supersymmetry (SUSY), graviton or Dark Matter. The
LHC has been built to facilitate experiments and research for at least a decade
to come, so software written to run and simulate research must be maintained
for more than 10 years. </p>
<p>Something that has become obvious to Vincent is that the days of big data
science using CPUs alone is no longer viable, with more and more data being
produced and increasingly complex experiments. This is motivating the National
Laboratories in the United States to investigate how they can target large GPU
based supercomputers without having to use proprietary programming models. SYCL
has become a focus, it enables developers to use ISO standard C++ code, is open
and defined by the industry, and with multiple implementations can target
Intel<b>®</b>, AMD
 and Nvidia<b>®</b>
 GPUs.</p>
<p>A problem that researchers using the LHC face is that they are required to
validate the measurements that have been made, and also ensure the detector is
functioning nominally. The validation of the measurements requires the use of
lots of Monte Carlo simulations which when run on the existing machines can
take minutes for just a single simulated event, and when further upgrades are
made to the LHC this could increase many-fold. In addition to this
reproducibility and productivity are essential for researchers working on this
validation.</p>
<p>Monte Carlo simulations require lots of random numbers to be generated and
it's well known that GPUs can be used very effectively to execute Random Number
Generator (RNG) algorithms. Vincent wants to make it possible to target the
Perlmutter, Frontier, Aurora, El Capitan supercomputers with a single code base
using the SYCL open standard programming model. This is the real focus of the
paper and presentation where Vincent talks about how the RNG algorithm was
added to the oneMKL library implemented using SYCL. This library makes it
possible to target Intel, Nvidia and AMD GPUs from a single code base and
interface. The algorithm was benchmarked using real data and demonstrates very
promising performance portability across multiple GPU architectures using
Codeplay's implementations for Nvidia and AMD GPUs with DPC++, an open source
SYCL compiler project.</p>

<p>Vincent expands on the growing number of potential future projects, for
example in further quantum simulations, that can take advantage of both SYCL
and the oneAPI oneMKL library for many other experiments and research. </p>
<p>I for one look forward to seeing how SYCL can help researchers make new
discoveries using the CERN Large Hadron Collider and Codeplay is continuing to
collaborate with Vincent to make further optimizations to the kernels used in
this paper.</p>
