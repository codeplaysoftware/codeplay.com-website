<p>Codeplay will be attending the STAC Summit 2016 in New York City on 13th June 2016
</p>
<p>
STAC (Securities Technology Analysis Center) Meetings bring together industry leaders to focus on challenging areas of financial technology. They range from large in-person gatherings (STAC Summits) to webinars and working group teleconferences.
</p>
<p>
As well as a packed and varied agenda on the topics of Big Data, Fast Data and Big Compute, the keynote speech will be given by our very own Michael Wong, Codeplay's VP of Research &amp; Development, and who is also Chair of ISO C++ Committee SG14 and SG5.
</p>
<p>
Michael's topic is &quot;Giving HFT a voice in C++&quot; : Despite its extensive use of C++, the traditionally secretive HFT industry hasn't had much influence on the direction of the programming language itself. Is that about to change? The ISO C++ committee's study group SG14 has recently begun reaching out to HFT developers to elicit their input to C++ standards, and some are getting involved. As head of SG14, Michael will explain how the process works, what kind of enhancements are under consideration, and how you can get involved.
