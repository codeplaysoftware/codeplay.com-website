<p>
Codeplay are continuing to collaborate on research into low-power GPUs, with a new European Union-funded research project to develop a power analysis tool to make the GPU more power efficient. This project follows on from a previous collaborative European Union funded project, LPGPU.
</p>
<p>
Codeplay have teamed up with Samsung, Greece-based silicon IP developer ThinkSilicon and TU-Berlin to develop a tool for enabling smartphone batteries to last longer while running advanced video games and using the camera.
</p>
<p>
Andrew Richards, Codeplay CEO said : This will enable us to solve a very challenging problem : lengthening battery life of smartphones while running the most advanced graphics processing."
</p>
<p>
The project has secured an EU grant of €2.97m and builds on the groundbreaking research of LPGPU1.
</p>
<p>
Professor Ben Juurlink, project co-ordinator at TU-Berlin said:
</p>
<p>
"Searching for the performance and energy bottlenecks in applications running on embedded GPUs is like searching for a needle in a haystack. "
</p>
<p>
According to Juurlink, there is a real need to provide smart analysis and visualisation tools.
</p>
<p>
"Current embedded GPUs are powerful enough to execute immersive applications that we could only dream of a few years ago. However, all this compute power is good for nothing if the battery only lasts for a few minutes."
</p>
<p>
Dr. Iakovos Stamoulis, CTO of ThinkSilicon, believes the constrained power budget of new mobile and IoT Wearable Devices shifts the design focus from performance to power in order to meet the toughest specifications.
</p>
<p>
"It is of absolute importance to holistically optimise systems at all levels : hardware, algorithmic and application software to minimize power consumption. The LPGPU2 project will provide the means to measure, explore and identify energy usage, which is of the utmost performance to achieve the required efficiency."
</p>
<p>
The project aims to define new industry standards for resource and performance monitoring to be widely adopted by embedded hardware GPU vendors (Khronos Group). It also wants to enhance existing dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) mechanisms to optimise power and performance.
