<p>In
 Codeplay we want to build the largest open source ecosystem for 
accelerators. This requires profound work in compilers and programming 
models that can translate the high-level intents of developers into code
 modern hardware processors and accelerators can execute. We deploy 
open-standards programming models, such as SYCL and OpenCL, onto our 
customer's hardware by implementing open source software stack combined 
with our own internal products. As part of this work, we have teams 
working on every stage of compiler pipeline, from clang C++ frontend all
 the way to CodeGen. </p><p>Your
 primary responsibilities will be to implement and improve compilers for
 programming models such as OpenCL™ or SYCL to target brand-new hardware
 such as GPUs, mobile CPUs and DSPs. Writing, testing, debugging and 
maintaining code, whilst interacting closely with other team members and
 clients, is a central part of the job. You will spend a great part of 
your day collaborating with other engineers in design and implementation
 of complex features across a modern C++ stack that goes from high-level
 C++ down to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.khronos.org/spir/">SPIR™-V</a>
 or assembly level.&nbsp; We put a strong emphasis on testing, documentation 
and tutorials to enable customer teams to do their own integration and 
customisation work, and we embrace working in open source projects and 
open standards as part of our day to day work.</p><p>This position requires a good understanding of LLVM, but other compilers and experience may be considered for the role.</p><p>The position is permanent and may be based at our&nbsp;<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/SexqmVVjJHm">head office</a> in central Edinburgh. The successful candidate must be able to demonstrate the right to work in the UK, or be eligible to apply for the right to work, should relocation be an agreed option.</p><p>We are committed to providing flexible working options such as part-time/compressed hours/timeshifting/remote/hybrid. There is also the potential to work fully remotely from France, Italy, Slovenia, Ireland, Germany, Spain, Poland provided the candidate has the existing Right To Work in the EU.</p><p>Positions are available at various levels, from entry-level to senior positions, depending on your skills and experience.</p><p><i>Starting salary: Competitive &amp; Negotiable</i></p>

<h2>What We Offer</h2><p>Codeplay
 is internationally recognized as being at the forefront of software 
development technology. Working at Codeplay offers unique opportunities 
and challenges to learn new technologies and to get involved in shaping 
the software industry. Codeplay's projects range from: creating tools 
and tool sets (optimizing compilers, debuggers, profilers, programming 
models &amp; APIs, test systems/suites, etc.) for brand-new unannounced 
next-generation hardware; developing and optimizing current machine 
learning (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow™</a>)
 and computer vision applications; research and development into 
lowering the power consumption of mobile devices; and contributing to 
new programming models and software standards (e.g. C++, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/sycl/">SYCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/">Vulkan®</a> and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/spir/">SPIR™-V</a>).</p><p>Codeplay
 Software is a world pioneer in enabling acceleration technologies used 
in AI, HPC and automotive. Codeplay was established in 2002 in 
Edinburgh, Scotland and developed some of the first tools enabling 
complex software to be accelerated using graphics processors. Today, 
most AI software is developed using graphics processors designed for 
video games, and more recently specialised AI and computer vision 
accelerators. Codeplay continues to work with global technology leaders 
to make the latest complex AI systems programmable using open-standards 
based programming languages and allows application developers to quickly
 bring software to the market.&nbsp; Codeplay is also deeply involved with 
the definition of open standards, especially OpenCL™, SPIR™, SYCL™, and 
Vulkan™ through The Khronos Group, and MISRA C++ for automotive. 
Codeplay was adquired in July 2022 by Intel, and operates as a fully 
independent subsidiary.</p><ul><li>A friendly and relaxed working environment where colleagues respect and support each other.</li><li>Learn
