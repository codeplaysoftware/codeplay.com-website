title: "Autoware SYCL/Nvidia port Internship"
date: 2022-03-10T13:06:20.315000+00:00
layout: company/careers/view
type: internship
description: An exciting Internship opportunity is available within the Safety Engineering division at Codeplay. The Autoware Foundation is developing open-source software for autonomous driving in the vehicles of tomorrow. Some algorithms in the reference implementation make use of CUDA to accelerate kernels on NVidia GPUs. In the automotive industry, however, there is interest in moving away from proprietary programming models and embrace open and portable standards. SYCL is an open-standard alternative to CUDA and runs on a variety of accelerators. Click on the link to find out more!

<p>The Autoware Foundation is developing open-source software 
for autonomous driving in the vehicles of tomorrow. Some algorithms in 
the reference implementation make use of CUDA to accelerate kernels on 
NVidia GPUs. In the automotive industry, however, there is interest in 
moving away from proprietary programming models and embrace open and 
portable standards. SYCL is an open-standard alternative to CUDA and 
runs on a variety of accelerators.</p><p>Codeplay have developed an 
NVidia back-end for the open-source DPC++ SYCL implementation developed 
by Intel, which allows SYCL applications to be run on NVidia GPUs as 
well. This allows the comparison of performance of SYCL and CUDA on the 
same platform.</p><p><strong>Please Note</strong>:
<i> Due to COVID-19 we are following the Scottish Government Roadmap and, 
although we are operating normally, we have not yet returned to the 
office.</i></p><p><i>The successful candidate should be able to
 work from home for the duration of the office closure. The position is a
 temporary internship. The successful candidate must be able to 
demonstrate the existing right to work in the UK.</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p>Although
 this internship is on offer for a duration of 3-6 months, we are 
delighted to accept applications for longer internships and many of our 
interns have stayed with us to do university placement years or have 
become permanent members of our team.</p><h2>Responsibilities</h2><ul><li>Choose an Autoware demo that uses CUDA and get it running on ARM+NVidia hardware.</li><li>Port the demo from CUDA to SYCL and get it running on DPC++ with the NVidia backend.</li><li>Compare
 the performance of CUDA vs. SYCL implementations. Optimise the SYCL 
port to better match, or exceed, the performance of the CUDA 
application.</li><li>Optionally run the ported demo with an OpenCL backend. ARM Mali may be a good target.</li><li>Write up the effort involved, the experience of the process and the resulting execution speed in a blog post / paper.</li></ul><h2>What We Offer</h2><p>Codeplay
 is internationally recognized as being at the forefront of software 
development technology. Working at Codeplay offers unique opportunities 
and challenges to learn new technologies and to get involved in shaping 
the software industry. Codeplay's projects range from: creating tools 
and tool sets (optimizing compilers, debuggers, profilers, programming 
models &amp; APIs, test systems/suites, etc.) for brand-new unannounced 
next-generation hardware; developing and optimizing current machine 
learning (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow™</a>)
 and computer vision applications; research and development into 
lowering the power consumption of mobile devices; and contributing to 
new programming models and software standards (e.g. C++, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/sycl/">SYCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/">Vulkan®</a> and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/spir/">SPIR™-V</a>).</p><p>Codeplay
 Software is a world pioneer in enabling acceleration technologies used 
in AI, HPC and automotive. Codeplay was established in 2002 in 
Edinburgh, Scotland and developed some of the first tools enabling 
complex software to be accelerated using graphics processors. Today, 
most AI software is developed using graphics processors designed for 
video games, and more recently specialised AI and computer vision 
accelerators. Codeplay continues to work with global technology leaders 
to make the latest complex AI systems programmable using open-standards 
based programming languages and allows application developers to quickly
 bring software to the market.&nbsp; Codeplay is also deeply involved with 
the definition of open&nbsp;standards, especially&nbsp;OpenCL™, SPIR™, SYCL™, and 
Vulkan™ through The Khronos Group, and MISRA C++ for automotive.</p><ul><li>A friendly and relaxed working environment where colleagues respect and support each other.</li><li>Learn
 from experienced colleagues: our staff frequently give company-wide 
knowledge-sharing presentations on new software and technology trends, 
personal projects and other relevant subjects.</li><li>Great career prospects within a growing company<ul><li>Newstart mentoring scheme</li></ul></li><li>Flexible working hours</li><li>Frequent company social events (social nights, pot luck lunches, gaming, karting, outdoor adventures, and more) (Post-COVID!)</li></ul><h2>Required Skills</h2><p>The
 ideal candidate is a self-motivated individual who can work through a 
problem from start to finish, meet deadlines as required to support 
software projects, and has the ability to work under pressure. You will 
be working on technology that is seldom announced to the public and 
could be several years away from public release, so confidentiality is 
critical. You should be able to work both independently and 
collaboratively within teams of varying skill sets and expertise. You 
should be welcoming towards, and able to adapt to, the introduction of 
new technologies, responsibilities and projects, as Codeplay works with 
cutting-edge technology and takes on a diverse range of projects.</p><ul><li>SYCL experience</li></ul><h2>Beneficial Skills</h2><p>Knowledge
 and/or experience of any of the following would be useful for the role,
 but are not essential. You must be able to learn new skills, but will 
be given support from Codeplay's team to get you up to speed.</p><ul><li>CUDA experience</li><li>Autoware experience</li><li>Experience with any automotive applications</li></ul><h2>Application Guidance</h2><p>Any
 application which results in a job offer is conditional upon the 
candidate already having or successfully applying for the right to work 
in the UK. Codeplay is proud to be an Equal Opportunities employer. We
