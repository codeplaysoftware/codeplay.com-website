Codeplay is internationally recognised as being at the forefront of developing modern software standards and tools. We are looking for enthusiastic graduates, who have a huge interest and passion about software engineering and can demonstrate it, for example through project work (hobby or university) or contributions to the open-source community. This is an opportunity to learn about new software standards and technologies, and to contribute to the implementation of compilers, debuggers, runtimes, libraries, demos and other tools targeting GPUs, Mobile/Embedded CPUs, and DSPs. Many of these systems or technologies are not yet publicly announced and therefore require confidentiality, so this is an opportunity work with brand-new hardware and software before anyone else does!

Candidates should be responsible programmers with a good working knowledge of modern C++. The ideal candidate is a self-motivated individual who can work through a problem from start to finish, documenting each step and writing tests to ensure correctness. As a graduate engineer, they will be comfortable with asking colleagues for help, or scouring documentation for relevant information required to complete assigned tasks.

The position is permanent and may be based at our [head office](https://goo.gl/maps/SexqmVVjJHm) in central Edinburgh. The successful candidate must be able to demonstrate the right to work in the UK, or be eligible to apply for the right to work, should relocation be an agreed option. We are committed to providing flexible working options such as part-time/compressed hours/timeshifting/remote/hybrid. There is also the potential to work fully remotely from France, Italy, Slovenia, Ireland, Germany, Spain or Poland provided the candidate has the existing Right To Work in the EU.

_Starting salary: Competitive & Negotiable_

## Who We Are

Working at Codeplay offers unique opportunities and challenges to learn new technologies and to get involved in shaping the software industry. Codeplay's projects range from: creating tools and tool sets (optimizing compilers, debuggers, profilers, programming models & APIs, test systems/suites, etc.) for brand-new unannounced next-generation hardware; developing and optimizing current machine learning ([TensorFlow™](https://www.tensorflow.org/)) and computer vision applications; research and development into lowering the power consumption of mobile devices; and contributing to new programming models and software standards (e.g. C++, [SYCL™](https://www.khronos.org/sycl/), [OpenCL™](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/), [Vulkan®](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) and [SPIR™-V](https://www.khronos.org/spir/)).

Codeplay is an active contributor in the community for the [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/), [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) and [LLDB](http://lldb.llvm.org/) open-source compiler and debugger projects. Our engineers are also leading the effort to bring support for machine learning with TensorFlow to OpenCL-enabled devices, by adding support for SYCL (the C++ high-level programming model built on OpenCL) to the open-source codebase. We have also contributed a CUDA backend to Intel's DPC++ Compiler and libraries, bringing the oneAPI initiative to the NVIDIA platform. We are building an ecosystem around the SYCL standard, including public projects for computer vision, linear algebra, and C++ parallel programming APIs - see <https://github.com/codeplaysoftware>. If you are excited about contributing to programming tools that will be used by developers worldwide, please get in touch!

Codeplay Software is a world pioneer in enabling acceleration technologies used in AI, HPC and automotive. Codeplay was established in 2002 in Edinburgh, Scotland and developed some of the first tools enabling complex software to be accelerated using graphics processors. Today, most AI software is developed using graphics processors designed for video games, and more recently specialised AI and computer vision accelerators. Codeplay continues to work with global technology leaders to make the latest complex AI systems programmable using open-standards based programming languages and allows application developers to quickly bring software to the market. Codeplay is also deeply involved with the definition of open standards, especially OpenCL™, SPIR™, SYCL™, and Vulkan™ through The Khronos Group, and MISRA C++ for automotive.
