<p>Language runtimes are key components to enable heterogeneous programming models such as OpenCL or SYCL to efficiently target various modern heterogeneous hardware platforms. C++ engineers within Codeplay contribute to and implement the specifications for such programming models, and provide a driver development kit to let third-parties target those programming models to a wide range of hardware.</p><p>C++ engineers at Codeplay have the opportunity to work on implementing a range of programming models from SYCL for heterogeneous C++ to the widely portable OpenCL. Our product's design and documentation lets customer teams use our driver development kit to provide mature and efficient implementations for a wide-range of parallel hardware . Codeplay engineers are also strong contributors to the standards they implement, particularly in the area of heterogeneous programming models, and C++ engineers get the opportunity to propose and work on extensions and changes to these standards. Engineering teams in Codeplay are strongly collaborative and you'll spend some of your time working with other engineers on the design of complex features and participating in design and code-reviews. This provides opportunities to both learn from and share your own experience with the team. Our products are all modern C++ code bases with a strong emphasis on quality, maintainability and testability. As a C++
engineer you will be expected to contribute to these code bases and to help with the continued effort to raise the bar on their quality and capabilities. As a runtime engineer you will have a strong influence on the direction and design of both Codeplay's products and open standards for heterogeneous computing.</p><p>The position is permanent and may be based at our&nbsp;<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/SexqmVVjJHm">head office</a> in central Edinburgh. The successful candidate must be able to demonstrate the right to work in the UK, or be eligible to apply for the right to work, should relocation be an agreed option.</p><p>We are committed to providing flexible working options such as part-time/compressed hours/timeshifting/remote/hybrid. There is also the potential to work fully remotely from France, Italy, Slovenia, Ireland, Germany, Spain, Poland provided the candidate has the existing Right To Work in the EU.</p><p>Positions are available at various levels, from entry-level to senior positions, depending on your skills and experience.</p>
