<p>Codeplay is the main developer and maintainer of several
SYCL-based libraries, targeting several common HPC workloads. SYCL-DNN
is a pure SYCL library that aims to provide performance-portable
implementations of frequently used Deep Neural Network (DNN) operators
such as convolution, pooling, activation functions and batch
normalization. During the internship you will be tasked with
implementing new DNN operators, extending the capabilities of
pre-existing ones, and designing the best possible API structure for
those operators.&nbsp;In addition to that, you will learn how to test,
benchmark, and make sure that your code is up to the standards required
for a production-level library.</p><p>The ideal candidate is someone
with a strong interest in both High Performance Computing, and Deep
Learning, able to both work autonomously on a task and to share their
progress and blockers within a team.&nbsp;</p><p>This internship is on offer
for a duration of 3-6 months. Although we usually offer internships for
the summer, we are delighted to accept applications for longer or
shorter internships and many of our interns have stayed with us to do
university placement years or have become permanent members of our team.</p><p>The
 position is temporary and will be based at our head office in central
Edinburgh. The successful candidate must, by the start of their
employment, have successfully obtained the right to work in the UK.&nbsp;</p><p>Starting salary - Competitive &amp; Negotiable <br></p><h2>Responsibilities</h2><ul><li>You will:<ul><li>Improve you knowledge about Deep Learning operators, particularly how they are implemented and optimized.</li><li>Work on state-of-the-art, production level deep learning library.</li><li>Improve your knowledge of SYCL and heterogeneous programming.</li><li>Improve your C++ skills.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>What We Offer</h2><p>Codeplay
 is internationally recognized as being at the forefront of software
development technology. Working at Codeplay offers unique opportunities
and challenges to learn new technologies and to get involved in shaping
the software industry. Codeplay's projects range from: creating tools
and tool sets (optimizing compilers, debuggers, profilers, programming
models &amp; APIs, test systems/suites, etc.) for brand-new unannounced
next-generation hardware; developing and optimizing current machine
learning (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow™</a>)
 and computer vision applications; research and development into
lowering the power consumption of mobile devices; and contributing to
new programming models and software standards (e.g. C++, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/sycl/">SYCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/">Vulkan®</a> and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/spir/">SPIR™-V</a>).</p><p>Codeplay
 Software is a world pioneer in enabling acceleration technologies used
in AI, HPC and automotive. Codeplay was established in 2002 in
Edinburgh, Scotland and developed some of the first tools enabling
complex software to be accelerated using graphics processors. Today,
most AI software is developed using graphics processors designed for
video games, and more recently specialised AI and computer vision
accelerators. Codeplay continues to work with global technology leaders
to make the latest complex AI systems programmable using open-standards
based programming languages and allows application developers to quickly
 bring software to the market.&nbsp; Codeplay is also deeply involved with
the definition of open&nbsp;standards, especially&nbsp;OpenCL™, SPIR™, SYCL™, and
Vulkan™ through The Khronos Group, and MISRA C++ for automotive.</p><ul><li>A friendly and relaxed working environment where colleagues respect and support each other.</li><li>Learn

new technologies, responsibilities and projects, as Codeplay works with
cutting-edge technology and takes on a diverse range of projects.</p><ul><li>Experience with C++.</li><li>&nbsp;Experience with one of the following: <ul><li>CUDA, OpenCL or SYCL (HPC/GPU programming experience)</li><li>&nbsp;Some familiarity with neural networks and Deep Learning algorithms and frameworks.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Beneficial Skills</h2><p>Knowledge
 and/or experience of any of the following would be useful for the role,
 but are not essential. You must be able to learn new skills, but will
be given support from Codeplay's team to get you up to speed.</p><ul><li>Modern (&gt; 17) C++ familiarity, and advanced C++ features (template meta-programming).</li><li>Experience implementing Deep Learning operators</li><li>GPU programming optimization techniques.</li></ul><h2>Application Guidance</h2><p>Any
 application which results in a job offer is conditional upon the
candidate already having or successfully applying for the right to work
in the UK. Codeplay is proud to be an Equal Opportunities employer. We
celebrate and value diversity. We are committed to creating an inclusive
