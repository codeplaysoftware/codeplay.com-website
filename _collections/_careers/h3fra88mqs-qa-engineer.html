<p>        </p><p>We are 
looking for an experienced QA Engineer to document and improve the 
testing of our products, so they can be used in a safety critical 
application, such as in an autonomous vehicle.</p><p>Codeplay
 is known for implementing OpenCL™ and SYCL™ runtimes and compilers for 
their customers' acceleration platforms. Now we aim to target customers 
in the automotive sector, who aim to run highly complex AI algorithms on
 their accelerators, which will provide advanced driving assistance 
(ADAS) and autonomous driving (AD) features to make our roads safer. To 
support these customers Codeplay needs to adhere to safety standards, 
which demand a high level of test coverage and a variety of testing 
techniques, as well as documentation thereof.</p><p>Your
 job is to analyse and document what testing we perform now and what 
gaps remain. This involves reading and understanding complex, modern C++
 code. You will develop plans to expand automated testing to achieve 
more coverage and incorporate a larger variety of techniques, working 
with the safety team to determine requirements. You will research the 
latest testing tools, frameworks and techniques.</p><p>In the future there may be an opportunity for you to acquire a team of testers to help you put your plans into action.</p><div>The position is permanent and may be based at our&nbsp;<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/SexqmVVjJHm">head office</a>
 in central Edinburgh. The successful candidate must be able to 
demonstrate the right to work in the UK, or be eligible to apply for the
 right to work, should relocation be an agreed option. <br></div><div><br></div><p>Salary : Competitive &amp; Negotiable</p><h2>What We Offer</h2><p>Codeplay
 is internationally recognized as being at the forefront of software 
development technology. Working at Codeplay offers unique opportunities 
and challenges to learn new technologies and to get involved in shaping 
the software industry. Codeplay's projects range from: creating tools 
and tool sets (optimizing compilers, debuggers, profilers, programming 
models &amp; APIs, test systems/suites, etc.) for brand-new unannounced 
next-generation hardware; developing and optimizing current machine 
learning (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow™</a>)
 and computer vision applications; research and development into 
lowering the power consumption of mobile devices; and contributing to 
new programming models and software standards (e.g. C++, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/sycl/">SYCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/">Vulkan®</a> and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/spir/">SPIR™-V</a>).</p><p>Codeplay
 Software is a world pioneer in enabling acceleration technologies used 
in AI, HPC and automotive. Codeplay was established in 2002 in 
Edinburgh, Scotland and developed some of the first tools enabling 
complex software to be accelerated using graphics processors. Today, 
most AI software is developed using graphics processors designed for 
video games, and more recently specialised AI and computer vision 
accelerators. Codeplay continues to work with global technology leaders 
to make the latest complex AI systems programmable using open-standards 
based programming languages and allows application developers to quickly
 bring software to the market.&nbsp; Codeplay is also deeply involved with 
the definition of open&nbsp;standards, especially&nbsp;OpenCL™, SPIR™, SYCL™, and 
Vulkan™ through The Khronos Group, and MISRA C++ for automotive.</p>
