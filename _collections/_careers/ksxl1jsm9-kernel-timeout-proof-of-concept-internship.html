title: "Kernel Timeout Proof of Concept Internship"
date: 2022-12-21T17:20:32.975000+00:00
layout: company/careers/view
type: internship
description: During this internship you will create proof-of-concept implementations of different mechanisms to report an error in case a kernel's computation has exceeded its time limit. Codeplay is known for implementing OpenCL™ and SYCL™ runtimes and compilers for their customers' acceleration platforms. Now we aim to target customers in the automotive sector, who want to run highly complex AI algorithms on their accelerators, which will provide advanced driving assistance (ADAS) and autonomous driving (AD) features to make our roads safer.

<p>Codeplay
 is known for implementing OpenCL™ and SYCL™ runtimes and compilers for
their customers' acceleration platforms. Now we aim to target customers
in the automotive sector, who want to run highly complex AI algorithms
on their accelerators, which will provide advanced driving assistance
(ADAS) and autonomous driving (AD) features to make our roads safer.</p><p>Software in the safety-critical domain is highly time-critical. For example in vision applications, each scene must be
 processed within a set time limit, otherwise a collision may happen
before an object is detected. On the other hand, it is accepted that all
 software fails occasionally, whether due to bugs remaining in the
software or malfunction of hardware. In safety-critical software it is
therefore important to detect errors reliably and quickly. An OpenCL or
SYCL kernel that exceeds its time limit, whether due to an infinite loop
 or a delay in processing, is an error for which there is currently no
reporting mechanism.</p><p>The successful candidate will create proof-of-concept implementations of different mechanisms to report an error in case a kernel's computation has exceeded its time limit.</p><p>This
 internship is on offer for a duration of 3-12 months. Although we
usually offer internships for the summer, we are delighted to accept
applications for longer or shorter internships and many of our interns
have stayed with us to do university placement years or have become
permanent members of our team.</p><p>The
 position is temporary and will be based at our head office in central
Edinburgh. The successful candidate must, by the start of their
employment, have successfully obtained the right to work in the UK.&nbsp;</p><p>Starting salary - Competitive &amp; Negotiable <br></p><h2>Responsibilities</h2><ul><li>You will investigate different approaches to restricting the execution time of a kernel.</li></ul><ol><li>A thread within the application that tracks time</li><li>A mechanism within the OpenCL runtime<ul><li>Investigate existing timeout extensions, for OpenCL and other standard</li><li>Modify
 Codeplay's OpenCL runtime to set the timer threshold and catch the
timeout error when it occurs, passing that error on to the user. At this
 stage it would be acceptable to hard-code the timer threshold and
report a generic (existing) error back to the user.</li><li>Develop an OpenCL extension that allows OpenCL users to specify an upper limit on the execution time of a kernel</li>
</ul></li></ol><ul><li>You will develop an example test case with an infinite kernel and demonstrate the effectiveness of each approach.</li><li>If
 possible (the HW can be reset), you will additionally write an OpenCL
application that handles a stream of "frames", where processing of some
frames times out, which are then skipped to continue with the rest.</li><li>If
 time remains, you will translate the sample applications into SYCL and
investigate options for an analogous kernel timeout extension for SYCL.</li></ul><h2>What We Offer</h2><p>Codeplay
 is internationally recognized as being at the forefront of software
development technology. Working at Codeplay offers unique opportunities
and challenges to learn new technologies and to get involved in shaping
the software industry. Codeplay's projects range from: creating tools
and tool sets (optimizing compilers, debuggers, profilers, programming
models &amp; APIs, test systems/suites, etc.) for brand-new unannounced
next-generation hardware; developing and optimizing current machine
learning (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow™</a>)
 and computer vision applications; research and development into
lowering the power consumption of mobile devices; and contributing to
new programming models and software standards (e.g. C++, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/sycl/">SYCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/">Vulkan®</a> and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/spir/">SPIR™-V</a>).</p><p>Codeplay
 Software is a world pioneer in enabling acceleration technologies used
in AI, HPC and automotive. Codeplay was established in 2002 in
Edinburgh, Scotland and developed some of the first tools enabling
complex software to be accelerated using graphics processors. Today,
most AI software is developed using graphics processors designed for
video games, and more recently specialised AI and computer vision
accelerators. Codeplay continues to work with global technology leaders
to make the latest complex AI systems programmable using open-standards
based programming languages and allows application developers to quickly
 bring software to the market.&nbsp; Codeplay is also deeply involved with
the definition of open&nbsp;standards, especially&nbsp;OpenCL™, SPIR™, SYCL™, and
Vulkan™ through The Khronos Group, and MISRA C++ for automotive.</p><ul><li>A friendly and relaxed working environment where colleagues respect and support each other.</li><li>Learn
 from experienced colleagues: our staff frequently give company-wide
knowledge-sharing presentations on new software and technology trends,
personal projects and other relevant subjects.</li><li>Great career prospects within a growing company</li><li>Newstart mentoring scheme</li><li>Flexible working hours</li><li>Frequent company social events (social nights, pot luck lunches, gaming, karting, outdoor adventures, and more) (Post-COVID!)</li></ul><h2>Required Skills</h2><p>The
 ideal candidate is a self-motivated individual who can work through a
problem from start to finish, meet deadlines as required to support
software projects, and has the ability to work under pressure. You will
be working on technology that is seldom announced to the public and
could be several years away from public release, so confidentiality is
critical. You should be able to work both independently and
collaboratively within teams of varying skill sets and expertise. You
should be welcoming towards, and able to adapt to, the introduction of
new technologies, responsibilities and projects, as Codeplay works with
cutting-edge technology and takes on a diverse range of projects.</p><ul><li>Experience with OpenCL</li><li>Experience with modern C++</li><li>Experience with multi-threading in C++</li></ul><h2>Beneficial Skills</h2><p>Knowledge
 and/or experience of any of the following would be useful for the role,
 but are not essential. You must be able to learn new skills, but will
be given support from Codeplay's team to get you up to speed.</p><ul><li>Experience with SYCL</li></ul><h2>Application Guidance</h2><p>Any
 application which results in a job offer is conditional upon the
candidate already having or successfully applying for the right to work
in the UK. Codeplay is proud to be an Equal Opportunities employer. We
celebrate and value diversity. We are committed to creating an inclusive
 environment for all employees, regardless of race, colour, gender,
religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, disability, age,
sexual orientation or any other characteristic protected by law. All

include one, stating why you believe you are a good fit for the
position. If you have examples of relevant work or projects, we would
love to see them, so please include links to them in your
application.You should be studying towards a degree in a relevant
subject; however, if you can prove skills and knowledge through
portfolio work, projects or previous employment, then a degree is not
essential.If
 you have C++ Code Samples (where relevant) please put the link to these
 on your application; our system will only accept links to personal
projects/GitHub accounts or PDF documents. <br></p><p><b>We aim to close this advert on the 28th April 2023, so please look
