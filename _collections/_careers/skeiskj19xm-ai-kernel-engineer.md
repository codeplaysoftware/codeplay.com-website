Codeplay's mission is to build the largest open ecosystem for accelerator computing targeting AI. To achieve this, we
work with partners to integrate open standards, such as SYCL, into applications and machine learning frameworks.

We are seeking a highly skilled **AI Kernel Programmer** to join our team. As an AI Kernel Programmer, you will be
responsible for developing, optimizing, and implementing software components for AI frameworks and hardware
accelerators. You will work at the intersection of **deep learning algorithms, system architecture, and hardware
acceleration** to push the boundaries of performance and efficiency in AI model execution. We work in open source and
internal projects like CUTLASS and Triton.

## Responsibilities

* Design and implement **custom AI kernels** for deep learning operators such as matrix multiplications, convolutions,
  and activation functions
* Optimize performance-critical components on **CPU, GPU, or other hardware accelerators**
* Collaborate with deep learning researchers to translate high-level models into **high-performance low-level code**
* Contribute to the internals of AI frameworks like **PyTorch, TensorFlow** or custom inference engines
* Write highly optimized parallel code using **SYCL.**
* Profile, debug, and benchmark kernel performance across multiple architectures
* Implement **hardware-specific optimizations** for emerging accelerators
* Driving multiple stages of software projects - from requirements gatherings to launch and validation
* Looking for what can be improved, and having a proactive attitude in helping other team members
* Participating in technical discussions, asking insightful questions, and contributing to scoping schedules, and
  solutions to issues
* Taking the initiative and assuming responsibility for solving technical problems
* Delivering documented software and standard methodologies
* Contributing to knowledge sharing of the company
* Communicate your ideas, work, and results to other team members and product owners

## Required Skills

The ideal candidate is a self-motivated individual who can work through a problem from start to finish, meet deadlines
as required to support software projects, and has the ability to work under pressure. You will be working on technology
that is seldom announced to the public and could be several years away from public release, so confidentiality is
critical. You should be able to work both independently and collaboratively within teams of varying skill sets and
expertise. You should be welcoming towards, and able to adapt to, the introduction of new technologies, responsibilities
and projects, as Codeplay works with cutting-edge technology and takes on a diverse range of projects

* Proficiency in **C/C++** and template meta programming
* Experience with **CUDA, OpenCL, or SYCL** for GPU programming. Understanding of parallel algorithms on different
  architectures
* Strong understanding of **computer architecture, memory hierarchy, and parallel computing**
* Experience with profiling and optimizing applications written in SYCL and oneAPI libraries
* Knowledge of **deep learning algorithms** and their computational building blocks
* Familiarity with **low-level optimization techniques** (SIMD, cache blocking, loop unrolling)
* Experience with performance profiling tools like **NVProf, VTune, Perf**
* Ability to write clean, maintainable, and optimized code
* Experience working in open source projects and doing community contributions

## Beneficial Skills

Knowledge and/or experience of any of the following would be useful for the role, but are not essential. You must be
able to learn new skills, but will be given support from Codeplay's team to get you up to speed.

* Experience developing/optimising **SYCL AI code**
* Familiarity with hardware-specific libraries like **cuDNN, CUTLASS, OneDNN.**
* Familiarity with LLM operators in **pytorch inductor backend**
* Hands-on experience with **AI framework internals** (PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX Runtime)
