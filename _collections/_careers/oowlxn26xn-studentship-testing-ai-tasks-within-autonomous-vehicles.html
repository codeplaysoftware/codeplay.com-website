<p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Location: </strong>3.5-year PhD, University of the Edinburgh (School of Informatics). Working closely with Codeplay Software Ltd. (Edinburgh)</p><p><strong>Funding:</strong> The Data Lab Industrial Doctorate and Codeplay Ltd.</p><p><strong>PhD start date</strong>: The successful applicant will be expected to start as soon as possible, 1 October 2023 or 1 January 2024.<br/></p> <p>We are looking to recruit a UK/EU PhD student at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh to work on developing testing techniques for Perception AI tasks running on hardware accelerators like GPUs, FPGAs.</p><p>Automotive manufacturers are competing to develop autonomous vehicles (AVs), which promise to save many lives on our roads in the future. Detection of vehicles, lanes and obstacles is accomplished by using artificial intelligence (AI) based perception systems and there is a pressing need for testing the safety of these systems to ensure they perform better than human drivers. Owing to the enormous amount of sensor data and processing power required, perception AI tasks heavily rely on high-end hardware accelerators like GPUs to parallelise basic machine learning operations.</p><p>Much of the existing literature for testing perception AI tasks has focussed on improving the training and testing datasets for the AI models such as generating scenes for adverse weather conditions, and adversarial test image generation. These techniques, however, have failed to consider safety violations caused by interactions of the AI applications with the underlying computing platform, namely hardware accelerators like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).</p><p>There are three main issues;</p><ul><li>Faults in AI task acceleration</li><li>Timing requirements and</li><li>Error handling</li></ul><p>The PhD candidate will tackle these issues with the aim of providing testing capabilities for AI tasks running on different AV platforms and accelerators. Objectives include;</p><ul><li>Testing and quality measurement of AI tasks on accelerators</li><li>Specifying and testing timing requirements</li><li>Specifying and testing the error handler</li></ul><p>The PhD position is jointly funded by Codeplay Software Ltd (https://<a href="http://www.codeplay.com/)">www.codeplay.com/) </a>and the Datalab (<a href="https://thedatalab.com/">https://thedatalab.com/</a>). The student will be jointly supervised by Dr. Ajitha Rajan at the School of Informatics in the University of Edinburgh (<a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/arajan/">https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/arajan/</a>) and by Dr. Mehdi Goli at Codeplay Software Ltd.</p><p>The successful candidate will join an excellent team of researchers at the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, ranked #16 in the world by QS University Rankings 2022. The School attracts students from around the world to study in our undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, and currently has approximately 1000 undergraduate students, 320 MSc students and 350 PhD students. The School of Informatics is recognised for the employability of its graduates (demand exceeds supply), its contributions to entrepreneurship, and the excellence of its research. The candidate will be supervised by Dr. Ajitha Rajan who is a Reader in the School of Informatics. Dr. Rajan's research interests are in the area of software testing and verification. Her work has been published at various international conferences in software engineering and testing. She is the Associate editor for the IET Software Journal. Dr. Rajan has been awarded grants from EPSRC, Royal Society, H2020, Facebook, GCHQ, Huawei, and SICSA. She was selected as one of the winners of the Facebook Testing and Verification Award in 2018 and 2019.</p><p>The successful candidate will also spend part of their PhD time at Codeplay Software. The company is headquartered in Edinburgh, with over 80 employees and is a leader in software portability and the development of software tools and supporting technologies for heterogeneous multi-core processor systems. Building on its proven expertise in games, mobile phone and HPC software, Codeplay has developed open standards and new products that address the pain points of deploying Artificial Intelligence applications into new HPC platforms and mass-produced devices, with a focus on the automotive sector, specifically Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving (AV)</p><h2><br/></h2><h1>Eligibility and Requirement</h1><p>Entry into this exciting research programme is competitive and will take account of qualifications, aspirations and experience.
