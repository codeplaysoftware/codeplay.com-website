<p>Codeplay's mission is to create an Open and Safe ecosystem for AI and HPC. To achieve this, we work with customers and partners to integrate open standards, such as SYCL, into applications and machine learning frameworks.<br></p><p>As a ML Library Engineer, you will interact with a large part of Codeplay's software stack, from BLAS libraries to AI frameworks both for internal customers and open source projects, working closely with customer teams. Project tasks will vary from implementing new routines or benchmarks to adding backend support for new hardware targets for customers.&nbsp; There are lots of new and exciting challenges to overcome and definitely lends itself to those who want to learn something new as tasks evolve.</p><p>Your primary responsibilities will be around delivering high performance machine learning solutions for target hardware. This will include both working on internal benchmarks for sales and marketing purposes, and working on customer use-case driven performance requirements.&nbsp; You will also be working on integrating additional machine learning models to our benchmarking; implementing additional algorithms in our libraries to enable acceleration of a wider range of machine learning models; helping to maintain our open source machine learning libraries; and potentially contributing to open standards for heterogeneous programming.</p><p>Please Note: Due to COVID-19 we are following the Scottish Government Roadmap and, although we are operating normally, the office is closed and we are all working from home.</p><p>The successful candidate should be able to work from home for the duration of the office closure.
