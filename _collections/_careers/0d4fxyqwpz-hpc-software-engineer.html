<p>        </p><p>Codeplay is helping to bring about a major change in the high
 performance computing community by helping software developers to 
migrate from proprietary programming models like CUDA to open standard 
SYCL, and we are looking for someone who can help us influence the 
industry by working directly with and educating developers on SYCL. You 
will be keen to learn how to develop applications with the SYCL 
programming model with DPC++ for CUDA, and use that knowledge to help us
 educate and support developers from high-profile organizations around 
the world. Your primary role will be to engage directly with 
organizations using SYCL to help them build performance portable code. 
You will be involved in writing complex HPC code and supporting 
developers writing HPC and AI code projects. In addition to this you 
will educate developers by creating sample code and projects, porting 
code from C++ and CUDA to SYCL and documenting how this was done through
 guides, blogs and possibly even videos. You will be using a variety of 
technologies from the SYCL ecosystem to support developers and show real
 world use cases for SYCL.</p><p>The ideal candidate is someone who is 
both an experienced software developer and is motivated by helping 
others, and can work through a problem from start to finish, documenting
 each step and writing tests to ensure correctness where applicable. You

 Software is a world pioneer in enabling acceleration technologies used 
in AI, HPC and automotive. Codeplay was established in 2002 in 
Edinburgh, Scotland and developed some of the first tools enabling 
complex software to be accelerated using graphics processors. Today, 
most AI software is developed using graphics processors designed for 
video games, and more recently specialised AI and computer vision 
accelerators. Codeplay continues to work with global technology leaders 
to make the latest complex AI systems programmable using open-standards 
based programming languages and allows application developers to quickly
 bring software to the market.&nbsp; Codeplay is also deeply involved with 
the definition of open&nbsp;standards, especially&nbsp;OpenCL™, SPIR™, SYCL™, and 
Vulkan™ through The Khronos Group, and MISRA C++ for automotive.</p><ul><li>A friendly and relaxed working environment where colleagues respect and support each other.</li><li>Learn
