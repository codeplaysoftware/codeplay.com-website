<p>        </p><p>Codeplay
 is known for being one of the leaders in the development of the SYCL™
standard and recently Codeplay has kick-started the design of SYCL SC, a
 version of SYCL targeted at safety-critical industries. In these
industries, such as automotive, avionics, nuclear and
 rail, safety is paramount, because a bug in the software could lead to
people being hurt. To be able to write safe, bug-free SYCL code
engineers have to be well trained in the SYCL programming model. This
means they need to not only need to learn how to write SYCL code, but
also to anticipate pitfalls and sources of errors. To complement the
existing SYCL tutorials and samples, we are looking to create a set of
negative tests and to organise them into a failure taxonomy. However,
instead of interface tests that misuse the SYCL API, the focus is on
applications that compile without errors but fail at runtime, perhaps even non-deterministically, or only on specific types of hardware.</p><p>In
 addition to educating users about how NOT to write SYCL code, these
tests can be incorporated into the test suites for the runtime, to
ensure that the implementation handles the errors gracefully as far as
possible. Error handling is a very important feature of software in a
safety-critical context and has to be extensively tested to ensure that
errors are caught and dealt with, which is why negative testing is
essential to ensure the safety of this kind of software.</p><p>Also, if analysis shows that
 certain SYCL features are more likely than others to lead to errors, it
 might suggest that these should be removed from the upcoming SYCL SC
specification, if possible.</p><p>This internship is on
offer for a duration of 3 months. Although we usually offer internships
for the summer, we are delighted to accept applications for longer or
shorter internships and many of our interns have stayed with us to do
university placement years or have become permanent members of our team.</p><p>The
 position is temporary and will be based at our head office in central
Edinburgh. The successful candidate must, by the start of their
employment, have successfully obtained the right to work in the UK.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Starting salary - Competitive &amp; Negotiable <br></i></p><h2>Responsibilities</h2><ul><li>You will<ul><li>Research
 and brain-storm the different ways a SYCL program can compile, but
fail/crash/hang. Some failure modes may only present on certain devices,
 e.g. CPUs/GPUs/DSPs.</li><li>Develop an organised, categorised set of SYCL tests that (may) fail, according to the specification.</li><li>Analyse the failure modes to categorise them, writing up the taxonomy of failing tests in a document.</li><li>Write a minimal SYCL test for each, describing the type and reason for failure in the comments.</li><li>Prepare a blog post and/or presentation describing the effort and its results.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>What We Offer</h2><p>Codeplay
 is internationally recognized as being at the forefront of software
development technology. Working at Codeplay offers unique opportunities
and challenges to learn new technologies and to get involved in shaping
the software industry. Codeplay's projects range from: creating tools
and tool sets (optimizing compilers, debuggers, profilers, programming
models &amp; APIs, test systems/suites, etc.) for brand-new unannounced
next-generation hardware; developing and optimizing current machine
learning (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow™</a>)
 and computer vision applications; research and development into
lowering the power consumption of mobile devices; and contributing to
new programming models and software standards (e.g. C++, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/sycl/">SYCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/">Vulkan®</a> and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/spir/">SPIR™-V</a>).</p><p>Codeplay
 Software is a world pioneer in enabling acceleration technologies used
in AI, HPC and automotive. Codeplay was established in 2002 in
Edinburgh, Scotland and developed some of the first tools enabling
complex software to be accelerated using graphics processors. Today,
most AI software is developed using graphics processors designed for
video games, and more recently specialised AI and computer vision
accelerators. Codeplay continues to work with global technology leaders
to make the latest complex AI systems programmable using open-standards
based programming languages and allows application developers to quickly
 bring software to the market.&nbsp; Codeplay is also deeply involved with
the definition of open&nbsp;standards, especially&nbsp;OpenCL™, SPIR™, SYCL™, and
Vulkan™ through The Khronos Group, and MISRA C++ for automotive.</p><ul><li>A friendly and relaxed working environment where colleagues respect and support each other.</li><li>Learn
 from experienced colleagues: our staff frequently give company-wide
knowledge-sharing presentations on new software and technology trends,
personal projects and other relevant subjects.</li><li>Great career prospects within a growing company</li><li>Newstart mentoring scheme</li><li>Flexible working hours</li><li>Frequent company social events (social nights, pot luck lunches, gaming, karting, outdoor adventures, and more) (Post-COVID!)</li></ul><h2>Required Skills</h2><p>The
 ideal candidate is a self-motivated individual who can work through a
problem from start to finish, meet deadlines as required to support
software projects, and has the ability to work under pressure. You will
be working on technology that is seldom announced to the public and
could be several years away from public release, so confidentiality is
critical. You should be able to work both independently and
collaboratively within teams of varying skill sets and expertise. You
should be welcoming towards, and able to adapt to, the introduction of
new technologies, responsibilities and projects, as Codeplay works with
cutting-edge technology and takes on a diverse range of projects.</p><ul><li>Modern C++ experience</li><li>Experience writing applications for SYCL, OpenCL or CUDA</li></ul><h2>Beneficial Skills</h2><p>Knowledge
 and/or experience of any of the following would be useful for the role,
 but are not essential. You must be able to learn new skills, but will
be given support from Codeplay's team to get you up to speed.</p><ul><li>Knowledge of the differences between CPUs, GPUs, DSPs, etc.</li></ul><h2>Application Guidance</h2><p>Any
 application which results in a job offer is conditional upon the
candidate already having or successfully applying for the right to work
in the UK. Codeplay is proud to be an Equal Opportunities employer. We
celebrate and value diversity. We are committed to creating an inclusive
 environment for all employees, regardless of race, colour, gender,
religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, disability, age,
sexual orientation or any other characteristic protected by law. All

include one, stating why you believe you are a good fit for the
position. If you have examples of relevant work or projects, we would
love to see them, so please include links to them in your
application.You should be studying towards a degree in a relevant
subject; however, if you can prove skills and knowledge through
portfolio work, projects or previous employment, then a degree is not
essential.If
 you have C++ Code Samples (where relevant) please put the link to these
 on your application; our system will only accept links to personal
projects/GitHub accounts or PDF documents. <br></p><p><b>We aim to close this advert on the 28th April 2023, so please look
