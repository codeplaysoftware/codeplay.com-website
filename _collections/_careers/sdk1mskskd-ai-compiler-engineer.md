Codeplay's mission is to build the largest open ecosystem for accelerated computing targeting AI. To achieve this, we
work with partners to integrate open standards, such as SYCL, into applications and machine learning frameworks.

We are seeking a highly skilled **AI Compiler Engineer** to join our team. As an AI Compiler Engineer, you will be
responsible for developing, optimizing, and implementing **compiler toolchains and intermediate representations** for AI
frameworks and hardware accelerators. You will work at the intersection of **deep learning algorithms, compiler design,
and hardware acceleration** to push the boundaries of performance and efficiency in AI model execution.

## Responsibilities

* Design and implement **compiler optimizations** for deep learning operators such as matrix multiplications, 
  convolutions, attention and activation functions
* Develop and optimize **graph compilation pipelines** for AI models on **CPU, GPU, or custom hardware accelerators**
* Collaborate with deep learning engineers to translate high-level models into **low-level IR (Intermediate 
  Representation)** and optimized machine code
* Contribute to the internals of AI frameworks like **PyTorch, TensorFlow**, or custom inference engines
* Implement **loop transformations, memory access optimizations, and hardware-specific code generation**
* Work with **MLIR and LLVM** to develop custom compiler passes
* Profile, debug, and benchmark compiler pipelines across multiple architectures
* Implement **hardware-specific optimizations** for emerging accelerators
* Contribute to open-source compiler and AI framework projects
* Taking the initiative and assuming responsibility for solving technical problems
* Delivering documented software and standard methodologies
* Communicate your ideas, work, and results to other team members and product owners
* Participating in technical discussions, asking insightful questions, and contributing to scoping schedules, and
  solutions to issues
* Contributing to knowledge sharing of the company

## Required Skills

The ideal candidate is a self-motivated individual who can work through a problem from start to finish, meet deadlines
as required to support software projects. You should be able to work both independently and collaboratively within teams
of varying skill sets and expertise. You should be welcoming towards, and able to adapt to, the introduction of new
technologies, responsibilities and projects, as Codeplay works with cutting-edge technology and takes on a diverse range
of projects.

* Proficiency in **C/C++**
* Experience with **LLVM**
* Experience with coding GPUs (CUDA, OpenCL, SYCL)
* Strong understanding of **compiler design, graph transformations, and optimization techniques**
* Knowledge of **deep learning algorithms** and their computational building blocks
* Experience with **parallel computing, optimizations for leveraging hierarchical memory architectures or SIMD/SIMT
  instruction paralellization**
* Knowledge and understanding of GPU or CPU profiling tools
* Knowledge of CPU/GPU/Embedded accelerator architectures
* Ability to write clean, maintainable, and optimized code

## Beneficial Skills

Knowledge and/or experience of any of the following would be useful for the role, but are not essential. You must be
able to learn new skills, but will be given support from Codeplay's team to get you up to speed.

* Familiarity with **MLIR** and **Triton**
* Familiarity with **AI framework internals** (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
* Contributions to open-source compiler or **AI libraries**
* Experience working with **DPC++** (clang, llvm, runtime)
* Experience with clang, LLVM backends, LLVM optimiser
* Knowledge of the **SPIR-V** specifications
* Proficiency with profiling tools like **VTune, Perf, or NVProf**
* Experience in producing papers and technical presentations
