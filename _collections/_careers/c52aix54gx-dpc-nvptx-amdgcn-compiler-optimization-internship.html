<p>SYCL is a C++-based heterogeneous programming standard for 
accelerator computing and oneAPI is an open-source ecosystem that 
includes SYCL support and library integration. &nbsp;The oneAPI framework 
provides a full stack of compilers, runtimes, libraries and tools for 
developing heterogeneous applications for various different domains. 
&nbsp;Within that framework Codeplay implements and maintains support for 
SYCL on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. &nbsp;A big part of this effort is optimizing 
the SYCL compiler such that the generated code has comparable 
performance to the native CUDA and HIP compilers. &nbsp;This internship will 
involve identifying areas where applications are not matching native 
performance due to missing compiler optimizations, and then creating 
implementations of those optimizations in the NVIDIA and AMD LLVM 
compiler backends.</p><p>The ideal candidate will be someone who has a 
strong interest in compilers and/or performance optimizations, and who 
is able to progress on tasks autonomously while sharing progress or 
blockers with their team.</p><p>This internship is on offer for a 
duration of 3-6 months. Although we usually offer internships for the 
summer, we are delighted to accept applications for longer or shorter 
internships and many of our interns have stayed with us to do university
 placement years or have become permanent members of our team.</p><p>The
 position is temporary and will be based at our head office in central 
Edinburgh. The successful candidate must, by the start of their 
employment, have successfully obtained the right to work in the UK.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Starting salary - Competitive &amp; Negotiable </i></p><h2>Responsibilities</h2><p>You will:</p><ul><li>Work as part of a development team supporting oneAPI on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.</li><li>Work on the implementation of SYCL on NVIDIA and AMD targets.</li><li>Learn about SYCL, DPC++, Clang, and LLVM from experienced engineers.</li><li>Design
 and implement compiler optimizations for the DPC++ compiler such as 
function inlining, loop unrolling, code generation and diagnostics.</li><li>Contribute patches to the DPC++ project or upstream LLVM.</li><li>Follow and contribute to performance guidelines for targeting NVIDIA and AMD GPUs with DPC++.</li><li>Build
 and run SYCL benchmarks as part of an iterative process to evaluate the
 performance of DPC++ and the impact of any improvements.</li><li>Identify possible additional benchmarks for evaluating the performance of DPC++, with the support of the rest of the team.</li></ul><h2>What We Offer</h2><p>Codeplay
 is internationally recognized as being at the forefront of software 
development technology. Working at Codeplay offers unique opportunities 
and challenges to learn new technologies and to get involved in shaping 
the software industry. Codeplay's projects range from: creating tools 
and tool sets (optimizing compilers, debuggers, profilers, programming 
models &amp; APIs, test systems/suites, etc.) for brand-new unannounced 
next-generation hardware; developing and optimizing current machine 
learning (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow™</a>)
 and computer vision applications; research and development into 
lowering the power consumption of mobile devices; and contributing to 
new programming models and software standards (e.g. C++, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/sycl/">SYCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/">Vulkan®</a> and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/spir/">SPIR™-V</a>).</p><p>Codeplay
 Software is a world pioneer in enabling acceleration technologies used 
in AI, HPC and automotive. Codeplay was established in 2002 in 
Edinburgh, Scotland and developed some of the first tools enabling 
complex software to be accelerated using graphics processors. Today, 
most AI software is developed using graphics processors designed for 
video games, and more recently specialised AI and computer vision 
accelerators. Codeplay continues to work with global technology leaders 
to make the latest complex AI systems programmable using open-standards 
based programming languages and allows application developers to quickly
 bring software to the market.&nbsp; Codeplay is also deeply involved with 
the definition of open&nbsp;standards, especially&nbsp;OpenCL™, SPIR™, SYCL™, and 
Vulkan™ through The Khronos Group, and MISRA C++ for automotive.</p><ul><li>A friendly and relaxed working environment where colleagues respect and support each other.</li><li>Learn
 from experienced colleagues: our staff frequently give company-wide 
knowledge-sharing presentations on new software and technology trends, 
personal projects and other relevant subjects.</li><li>Great career prospects within a growing company</li><li>Newstart mentoring scheme</li><li>Flexible working hours</li><li>Frequent company social events (social nights, pot luck lunches, gaming, karting, outdoor adventures, and more)</li></ul><h2>Required Skills</h2><p>The
 ideal candidate is a self-motivated individual who can work through a 
problem from start to finish, meet deadlines as required to support 
software projects, and has the ability to work under pressure. You will 
be working on technology that is seldom announced to the public and 
could be several years away from public release, so confidentiality is 
critical. You should be able to work both independently and 
collaboratively within teams of varying skill sets and expertise. You 
should be welcoming towards, and able to adapt to, the introduction of 
new technologies, responsibilities and projects, as Codeplay works with 
cutting-edge technology and takes on a diverse range of projects.</p><ul><li>C++ development experience.</li><li>Some level of compiler experience, e.g. coursework or research project.</li><li>Good written English and communication skills.</li><li>Working knowledge of source control and configuration management tools.</li></ul><h2>Beneficial Skills</h2><p>Knowledge
 and/or experience of any of the following would be useful for the role,
 but are not essential. You must be able to learn new skills, but will 
be given support from Codeplay's team to get you up to speed.</p><ul><li>Knowledge of Clang or LLVM.</li><li>Knowledge of NVPTX or AMDGCN.</li><li>Knowledge of heterogeneous programming, e.g. CUDA, SYCL, OpenCL, etc.</li><li>Knowledge of parallel architectures, such as GPUs.</li><li>Knowledge of build systems (e.g. CMake) and compiler tool-chains.</li><li>Experience working in a team.</li></ul><h2>Application Guidance</h2><p>Any
 application which results in a job offer is conditional upon the 
candidate already having or successfully applying for the right to work 
in the UK. Codeplay is proud to be an Equal Opportunities employer. We
