<p><b>CLOSING DATE - FRIDAY 16TH JULY - 5PM</b></p><p>Codeplay is working closely with a prestigious semiconductor vendor to enable and accelerate machine learning models on its high-performance specialised AI hardware, using an open-source AI graph compiler. Codeplay's work encompasses improvements at the graph compiler level to support new models, and performance optimizations to the compiler and directly to the micro-kernels that implement the nodes. Examples of typical optimizations include: vectorization, splitting operations across accelerator devices, reordering and combining operations to reduce data movement and computation, and using target-specific intrinsics to target custom processing units.</p><p>As the compiler and kernels are so intrinsically linked, an ideal candidate would be comfortable switching between roles and tackling problems wherever makes most sense.</p><p>This project involves working closely with engineers from the customer's large team and an existing successful team within Codeplay, providing opportunities to learn from an excellent and very experienced community of engineers. Your work will contribute to achieving benchmark results that are published publicly and shared with big customers, so this is an ideal opportunity for someone with a passion for making things go fast!</p><p>As a Software Engineer in the Customer Engineering division, you will be participating in projects delivering our software platform to internal and external customers. Projects and customers can vary over the years, and there are plenty of opportunities to learn new technologies and jump into different projects upon finishing one. There is also an internal recruitment process that allows moving across to other divisions to work in other areas of the company, such as Product Engineering, Ecosystem Development, Research, or Safety.</p><p>Please Note - Due to COVID-19 we are following the Scottish Government Roadmap and, although we are operating normally, the office is closed and we are all working from home.</p><p>The successful candidate should be able to work from home for the duration of the office closure. The position is permanent and may be based at our&nbsp;<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/SexqmVVjJHm">head office</a>&nbsp;in central Edinburgh. The successful candidate must be able to demonstrate the right to work in the UK, or be eligible to apply for the right to work, should relocation be an agreed option.</p><p>Positions are available at various levels, from entry-level to senior positions, depending on your skills and experience.</p><p>Starting salary: Competitive &amp; Negotiable.</p><h2>What We Offer</h2><p>Codeplay Software is a world pioneer in enabling acceleration technologies used in AI, HPC and automotive. Codeplay was established in 2002 in Edinburgh, Scotland and developed some of the first tools enabling complex software to be accelerated using graphics processors. Today, most AI software is developed using graphics processors designed for video games, and more recently specialised AI and computer vision accelerators. Codeplay continues to work with global technology leaders to make the latest complex AI systems programmable using open-standards based programming languages and allows application developers to quickly bring software to the market.&nbsp; Codeplay is also deeply involved with the definition of open&nbsp;standards, especially&nbsp;OpenCL™, SPIR™, SYCL™, and Vulkan™ through The Khronos Group, and MISRA C++ for automotive.</p><ul><li>A friendly and relaxed working environment where colleagues respect and support each other.</li><li>Learn from experienced colleagues: our staff frequently give company-wide knowledge-sharing presentations on new software and technology trends, personal projects and other relevant subjects.</li><li>Great career prospects within a growing company<ul><li>We develop our staff to progress quickly in their roles, and to take ownership of business functions, become experts, and/or lead teams.
