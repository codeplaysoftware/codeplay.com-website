<p>        </p><p>Codeplay is helping to bring about a major change in the high
 performance computing community by helping software developers to 
migrate from proprietary programming models like CUDA to open standard 
SYCL, and we are looking for someone who can help us influence the 
industry by showing how this migration can be done. You will be keen to 
learn how to develop applications with the SYCL programming model with 
DPC++ for CUDA and ComputeCpp, and use that knowledge to help us educate
 developers. During the internship you will be involved in porting code 
from C++ and CUDA to SYCL and documenting how this was done through 
guides, blogs and possibly even videos. &nbsp;You will be using a variety of 
technologies from the SYCL ecosystem to support developers and show real
 world use cases for SYCL.</p><p>The ideal candidate is someone who is 
both an engineer and is motivated by helping others, and can work 
through a problem from start to finish, documenting each step and 
writing tests to ensure correctness where applicable. You will be 
comfortable with asking colleagues for help, or scouring documentation 
for relevant information required to complete tasks. You will also be 
expected to produce high quality, readable and well-commented code that 
will be published as open source and used by the developer community.</p><p>This
 internship is on offer for a duration of 3 months. Although we usually 
offer internships for the summer, we are delighted to accept 
applications for longer or shorter internships and many of our interns 
have stayed with us to do university placement years or have become 
permanent members of our team.</p><p>The
 position is temporary and will be based at our head office in central 
Edinburgh. The successful candidate must, by the start of their 
employment, have successfully obtained the right to work in the UK.&nbsp;</p><p>Starting salary - Competitive &amp; Negotiable <br></p><h2>Responsibilities</h2><ul><li>Learning how to develop with the SYCL open standard API</li><li>Porting and adapting libraries and applications for SYCL</li><li>Writing technical guides, resources and mini applications</li></ul><h2>What We Offer</h2><p>Codeplay
 is internationally recognized as being at the forefront of software 
development technology. Working at Codeplay offers unique opportunities 
and challenges to learn new technologies and to get involved in shaping 
the software industry. Codeplay's projects range from: creating tools 
and tool sets (optimizing compilers, debuggers, profilers, programming 
models &amp; APIs, test systems/suites, etc.) for brand-new unannounced 
next-generation hardware; developing and optimizing current machine 
learning (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow™</a>)
 and computer vision applications; research and development into 
lowering the power consumption of mobile devices; and contributing to 
new programming models and software standards (e.g. C++, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/sycl/">SYCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/">Vulkan®</a> and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/spir/">SPIR™-V</a>).</p><p>Codeplay
 Software is a world pioneer in enabling acceleration technologies used 
in AI, HPC and automotive. Codeplay was established in 2002 in 
Edinburgh, Scotland and developed some of the first tools enabling 
complex software to be accelerated using graphics processors. Today, 
most AI software is developed using graphics processors designed for 
video games, and more recently specialised AI and computer vision 
accelerators. Codeplay continues to work with global technology leaders 
to make the latest complex AI systems programmable using open-standards 
based programming languages and allows application developers to quickly
 bring software to the market.&nbsp; Codeplay is also deeply involved with 
the definition of open&nbsp;standards, especially&nbsp;OpenCL™, SPIR™, SYCL™, and 
Vulkan™ through The Khronos Group, and MISRA C++ for automotive.</p><ul><li>A friendly and relaxed working environment where colleagues respect and support each other.</li><li>Learn
