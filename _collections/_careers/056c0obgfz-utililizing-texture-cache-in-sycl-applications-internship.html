<p>SYCL is a C++-based heterogeneous programming standard for 
accelerator computing. &nbsp;Codeplay works on implementations of this 
standard and are investigating creating and using extensions to the 
language to allow applications to fully use target hardware. This 
includes extensions to take advantage of GPU texture caches for 
efficient random access caching being implemented in the implementation 
of SYCL on top of CUDA.&nbsp; This is particularly useful in Molecular 
Dynamics applications but also some machine learning algorithms.</p><p>The
 original purpose of the texture cache in CUDA was to optimize read-only
 accesses of image data, and this cache can be most efficiently used by 
taking account of the 2D/3D spatial arrangement of that data. 
Correspondingly in 3D molecular dynamics simulations the indexing of 
molecules in data arrays can take account of the texture cache to boost 
the performance of read-only access patterns that are used by standard 
algorithms.&nbsp; In SYCL this can be accessed via an extension (<a href="https://github.com/intel/llvm/pull/7397">https://github.com/intel/llvm/pull/7397</a>).&nbsp;
 As a SYCL extension, however, use of the extension should be integrated
 in a way that provides a clean fallback if the extension is not 
present.&nbsp; Thus this internship will involve using this extension in a 
few existing frameworks and molecular dynamic applications, determining 
how much gain the extension use provides, and ensuring that performance 
is not impacted on hardware that does not provide the same texture cache
 benefits.&nbsp; As a stretch goal it could be possible to investigate how to
 add to the extension such that the programmer can access "hint" 
instructions to suggest where future accesses will be.</p><p>The ideal 
candidate will be someone who has a strong interest in heterogeneous 
programming, who is able to progress on tasks autonomously while sharing
 progress or blockers with their team.</p><p>This internship is on offer
 for a duration of 3-6 months. Although we usually offer internships for 
the summer, we are delighted to accept applications for longer or 
shorter internships and many of our interns have stayed with us to do 
university placement years or have become permanent members of our team.</p><p>The
 position is temporary and will be based at our head office in central 
Edinburgh. The successful candidate must, by the start of their 
employment, have successfully obtained the right to work in the UK.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Starting salary - Competitive &amp; Negotiable </i></p><h2>Responsibilities</h2><p><strong>You will:</strong></p><ul><li>Work as part of a team implementing SYCL on various GPUs and supporting HPC applications</li><li>Extend the Kokkos framework to take advantage of a SYCL extension for GPU texture cache loads</li><li>Improve you knowledge about Nvidia hardware with a focus on the texture cache</li><li>Work on state-of-the-art, production level Molecular Dynamics projects</li><li>Gain experience with optimizing and benchmarking heterogeneous codebases</li><li>Improve your knowledge of C++, SYCL, and heterogeneous programming</li></ul><h2>What We Offer</h2><p>Codeplay
 is internationally recognized as being at the forefront of software 
development technology. Working at Codeplay offers unique opportunities 
and challenges to learn new technologies and to get involved in shaping 
the software industry. Codeplay's projects range from: creating tools 
and tool sets (optimizing compilers, debuggers, profilers, programming 
models &amp; APIs, test systems/suites, etc.) for brand-new unannounced 
next-generation hardware; developing and optimizing current machine 
learning (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow™</a>)
 and computer vision applications; research and development into 
lowering the power consumption of mobile devices; and contributing to 
new programming models and software standards (e.g. C++, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/sycl/">SYCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/">Vulkan®</a> and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/spir/">SPIR™-V</a>).v</p><p>Codeplay
 Software is a world pioneer in enabling acceleration technologies used 
in AI, HPC and automotive. Codeplay was established in 2002 in 
Edinburgh, Scotland and developed some of the first tools enabling 
complex software to be accelerated using graphics processors. Today, 
most AI software is developed using graphics processors designed for 
video games, and more recently specialised AI and computer vision 
accelerators. Codeplay continues to work with global technology leaders 
to make the latest complex AI systems programmable using open-standards 
based programming languages and allows application developers to quickly
 bring software to the market.&nbsp; Codeplay is also deeply involved with 
the definition of open&nbsp;standards, especially&nbsp;OpenCL™, SPIR™, SYCL™, and 
Vulkan™ through The Khronos Group, and MISRA C++ for automotive.</p><ul><li>A friendly and relaxed working environment where colleagues respect and support each other.</li><li>Learn
