<p>Codeplay has a software platform called Acoran, that is 
designed to support C++ programming on a wide-range of hardware devices.
 &nbsp;These devices include some RISC-V targets and simulators, in this 
project we would like to add support for an additional academic 
multi-core RISC-V simulator. &nbsp;This project should allow us to test 
higher RISC-V core counts on a simulator than has previously been 
possible – this is of particular interest for the kind of 
massively-parallel programming models that Codeplay specializes in. 
&nbsp;Also, this simulator uses 32-bit RISC-V cores, our previous RISC-V work
 has targeted 64-bit cores.</p><p>The Acoran platform includes an 
implementation of the heterogeneous C++ programming standard SYCL, 
ComputeCpp, and a toolkit for running that on new devices via OpenCL or 
Vulkan, ComputeAorta. &nbsp;ComputeAorta does this by providing 
well-documented internal interfaces. &nbsp;This project will involve porting 
those interfaces to the new RISC-V simulator; using existing test-suites
 to determine the completeness of the simulator and implementation pair;
 and creating a demonstration for the new port.</p><p><strong>Please Note</strong>:
 Due to COVID-19 we are following the Scottish Government Roadmap and, 
although we are operating normally, we have not yet returned to the 
office.</p><p>The successful candidate should be able to
 work from home for the duration of the office closure. The position is a
 temporary internship. The successful candidate must be able to 
demonstrate the existing right to work in the UK.</p><p>Although
 this internship is on offer for a duration of 3 months, we are 
delighted to accept applications for longer internships and many of our 
interns have stayed with us to do university placement years or have 
become permanent members of our team.</p><h2>Responsibilities</h2><ul><li>Understand how ComputeAorta's internal interfaces work.</li><li>Port of boot code required to boot a program on the new simulator.</li><li>Create a new implementation of the simulator shim, tested on existing internal testsuites.</li><li>Run
 OpenCL and SYCL testsuites on top of simulator, documenting pass rates 
and areas of failures.&nbsp; 100% pass rate is not required inside this 
internship.</li><li>Choose some interesting demo application, e.g. 
SYCL-ONNX, that should work on the new simulator and resolve any issues 
stopping it from running.</li><li>Potentially, aid in improving our documentation for porting our software to new simulator or hardware targets.</li></ul><h2>What We Offer</h2><p>Codeplay
 is internationally recognized as being at the forefront of software 
development technology. Working at Codeplay offers unique opportunities 
and challenges to learn new technologies and to get involved in shaping 
the software industry. Codeplay's projects range from: creating tools 
and tool sets (optimizing compilers, debuggers, profilers, programming 
models &amp; APIs, test systems/suites, etc.) for brand-new unannounced 
next-generation hardware; developing and optimizing current machine 
learning (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow™</a>)
 and computer vision applications; research and development into 
lowering the power consumption of mobile devices; and contributing to 
new programming models and software standards (e.g. C++, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/sycl/">SYCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/">Vulkan®</a> and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/spir/">SPIR™-V</a>).</p><p>Codeplay
 Software is a world pioneer in enabling acceleration technologies used 
in AI, HPC and automotive. Codeplay was established in 2002 in 
Edinburgh, Scotland and developed some of the first tools enabling 
complex software to be accelerated using graphics processors. Today, 
most AI software is developed using graphics processors designed for 
video games, and more recently specialised AI and computer vision 
accelerators. Codeplay continues to work with global technology leaders 
to make the latest complex AI systems programmable using open-standards 
based programming languages and allows application developers to quickly
 bring software to the market.&nbsp; Codeplay is also deeply involved with 
the definition of open&nbsp;standards, especially&nbsp;OpenCL™, SPIR™, SYCL™, and 
Vulkan™ through The Khronos Group, and MISRA C++ for automotive.</p><ul><li>A friendly and relaxed working environment where colleagues respect and support each other.</li><li>Learn

new technologies, responsibilities and projects, as Codeplay works with 
cutting-edge technology and takes on a diverse range of projects.</p><ul><li>Excellent programming skills.</li><li>Some level of C++ experience.</li><li>Some level of experience working with large code-bases.</li><li>A keen interest in systems programming, e.g. compilers, simulators, emulators, operating systems, etc.</li><li>A desire to work within a small and focussed team.</li><li>Excellent written and spoken communication skills.</li></ul><h2>Beneficial Skills</h2><p>Knowledge
 and/or experience of any of the following would be useful for the role,
 but are not essential. You must be able to learn new skills, but will 
be given support from Codeplay's team to get you up to speed.</p><ul><li>Coursework or experience involving compilers or assembly, such as a compiler or computer architecture course.</li><li>Any form of low-level or systems programming, e.g. operating systems, development on embedded boards, etc.</li><li>Knowledge of OpenCL or SYCL, or any other parallel programming model.</li><li>Experience with build automation tools, such as CMake.</li><li>Experience with testing software, whether writing new tests or making using of existing test-suites.</li></ul><h2>Application Guidance</h2><p>Any
