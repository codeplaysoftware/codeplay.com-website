<div>In Codeplay, we enable the software of today to run on the hardware of tomorrow. This requires profound work in compilers and programming models that can translate the high-level intents of developers into code modern hardware processors and accelerators can execute. We deploy our open-standards programming models, such as SYCL and OpenCL, onto our customer hardware by implementing our software stack, Acoran, for multiple targets. This requires adapting our compiler infrastructure to exciting new pieces of tech, sometimes integrating with an existing customer-based compiler toolchain but sometimes writing our own compiler backends for new ISAs. Every customer is a new challenge where we learn more about the next trends in hardware architecture.</div><div><br></div><p>Your primary responsibilities will be to implement and improve compilers for programming models such as OpenCL™ or SYCL to target brand-new hardware such as GPUs, mobile CPUs and DSPs. Writing, testing, debugging and maintaining code, whilst interacting closely with other team members and clients, is a central part of the job. You will spend a great part of your day collaborating with other engineers in design and implementation of complex features across a modern C++ stack that goes from high-level C++ down to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.khronos.org/spir/">SPIR™-V</a> or assembly level. You will be part of a team of engineers with different skills that are delivering our software stack to a customer, or supporting a customer in integrating our software stack. Sometimes you will be working with our product and ecosystem teams directly on SYCL or OpenCL implementing specific features, or consulting on specific topics.</p><p>This position requires a good understanding of LLVM, but other compilers and experience may be considered for the role.</p><div>The position is permanent and may be based at our&nbsp;<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/SexqmVVjJHm">head office</a>
 in central Edinburgh. The successful candidate must be able to 
demonstrate the right to work in the UK, or be eligible to apply for the
 right to work, should relocation be an agreed option. <br></div><div><br></div><p>Starting salary: Competitive &amp; Negotiable.</p>
<h2>What We Offer</h2><p>Working at Codeplay offers unique opportunities and challenges to learn new technologies and to get involved in shaping the software industry. Codeplay's projects range from: creating tools and tool sets (optimizing compilers, debuggers, profilers, programming models &amp; APIs, test systems/suites, etc.) for brand-new unannounced next-generation hardware; developing and optimizing current machine learning (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow™</a>) and computer vision applications; research and development into lowering the power consumption of mobile devices; and contributing to new programming models and software standards (e.g. C++, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/sycl/">SYCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/">Vulkan®</a> and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/spir/">SPIR™-V</a>).</p><p>Codeplay was established in 2002 in Edinburgh, Scotland and developed some of the first tools enabling complex software to be accelerated using graphics processors. It is internationally recognized as being at the forefront of software development technology. Codeplay continues to work with global technology leaders to make the latest complex hardware systems programmable using open-standards based programming languages and allows application developers to quickly bring software to the market.&nbsp; Codeplay is also deeply involved with the definition of open standards, especially OpenCL™, SPIR™, SYCL™, and Vulkan™ through The Khronos Group, and MISRA C++ for automotive. </p><p>We offer:</p><ul><li>A friendly and relaxed working environment where colleagues respect and support each other.</li><li>Learn from experienced colleagues: our staff frequently give company-wide knowledge-sharing presentations on new software and technology trends, personal projects and other relevant subjects.</li><li>Great career prospects within a growing company<ul><li>We develop our staff to progress quickly in their roles, and to take ownership of business functions, become experts, and/or lead teams.
