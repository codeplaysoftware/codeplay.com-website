<p>We are looking for a Linear algebra and machine learning engineer interested in helping us leverage accelerators to support HPC architectures.</p><p>Codeplay is active in building compiler infrastructure, tools, libraries, frameworks, services, and products to enable and accelerate the next generation of research ideas. In the simplest form, improving the workflow has a super-linear impact on research efficiency, as not only does it free up more time - but the extra cognitive space can allow new research ideas to thrive that would otherwise never happen. Many recent breakthroughs in Machine learning research were made possible by the vast amounts of computational power from new hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPU, and Domain-specific accelerators. As a Linear algebra and machine learning engineer, you will Work on implementing SYCL-based math libraries(such as BLAS, LAPACK, FFT, etc), to enhance and expand our Machine learning and linear algebra software stack for various hardware accelerators and make it easy to use efficiently for our existing/future customers.</p><p>The position is permanent and may be based at our&nbsp;<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/SexqmVVjJHm">head office</a> in central Edinburgh.

<p><i></i></p><h2>Role</h2><p>You will be working in a team towards developing performance-portable SYCL-based Machine learning and linear algebra libraries to provide high-performance solutions for different application domains such as image processing, signal processing, and data transformation systems on different hardware platforms,&nbsp;producing the comparable result with the native vendor-optimized model. The team you will be in works across various projects in our libraries software stack and explores/analyses all components that influence performance: from developing high-performance kernel implementations for the proposed domain to applying optimization techniques such as parameterization and auto-tuning tools for efficiently launching the libraries on various platforms.</p><p><strong>Experience in GPGPU programming models (e.g. CUDA, OpenCL, SYCL) and understanding of parallel programming algorithms are essential for this role.</strong></p><h2>Responsibilities</h2><ul><li>Taking the initiative and assuming responsibility for solving technical problems.&nbsp;</li><li>Delivering documented software and standard methodologies.&nbsp;</li><li>Communicating your ideas, your work, and your results to other team members and product owners.&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;<strong>Writing accelerator-based kernels</strong> like GPUs, that achieve high levels of throughput and efficiency with your implementations.&nbsp;</li><li>Profiling software running on GPUs, using appropriate tools and techniques to find performance issues &amp; bottlenecks.&nbsp;</li><li>Driving multiple stages of software projects - from requirements gatherings to launch and validation.&nbsp;</li><li>Looking for what can be improved, and having a proactive attitude in helping other team members.</li><li>Participating in technical discussions, asking insightful questions, and contributing to scoping schedules, and solutions to issues</li><li>Having an interest in our mission and AI/Machine Learning/linear algebra.</li><li>Contributing to knowledge sharing of the company.</li></ul><h2>What We Offer</h2><p>Codeplay is internationally recognized as being at the forefront of software development technology. Working at Codeplay offers unique opportunities and challenges to learn new technologies and to get involved in shaping the software industry. Codeplay's projects range from creating tools and tool sets (optimizing compilers, debuggers, profilers, programming models &amp; APIs, test systems/suites, etc.) for brand-new unannounced next-generation hardware; developing and optimizing current machine learning (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow™</a>) and computer vision applications; research and development into lowering the power consumption of mobile devices; and contributing to new programming models and software standards (e.g. C++, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/sycl/">SYCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/">Vulkan®</a> and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/spir/">SPIR™-V</a>).</p><p>Codeplay Software is a world pioneer in enabling acceleration technologies used in AI, HPC and automotive. Codeplay was established in 2002 in Edinburgh, Scotland and developed some of the first tools enabling complex software to be accelerated using graphics processors. Today, most AI software is developed using graphics processors designed for video games, and more recently specialised AI and computer vision accelerators. Codeplay continues to work with global technology leaders to make the latest complex AI systems programmable using open-standards based programming languages and allows application developers to quickly bring software to the market.&nbsp; Codeplay is also deeply involved with the definition of open&nbsp;standards, especially&nbsp;OpenCL™, SPIR™, SYCL™, and Vulkan™ through The Khronos Group, and MISRA C++ for automotive.</p><ul><li>A friendly and relaxed working environment where colleagues respect and support each other.</li><li>Learn from experienced colleagues: our staff frequently give company-wide knowledge-sharing presentations on new software and technology trends, personal projects and other relevant subjects.</li><li>Great career prospects within a growing company<ul><li>We develop our staff to progress quickly in their roles, and to take ownership of business functions, become experts, and/or lead teams.
