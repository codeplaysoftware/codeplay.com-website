<p>Codeplay
 operates as a subsidiary business of Intel supporting the
multi-architecture, multi-vendor accelerator market. Codeplay is playing
 a key role in bringing about the wide adoption of SYCL and oneAPI
amongst processor vendors and software developers. SYCL is a
higher-level programming model based on standard C++ that improves
programming productivity on various hardware accelerators such as GPUs.
SYCL is a standard developed by the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/sycl/">Khronos Group</a>, announced in March 2014. <a href="https://www.oneapi.io/">oneAPI</a> defines a specification that builds on SYCL with tuned libraries for specific domains including math and machine learning.</p><p>Using
 oneAPI and SYCL it is possible to write accelerated code using C++ and
build a single application that can run on multiple architectures
including Intel GPUs, NVIDIA GPUs and AMD GPUs. This is enabling
projects including <a href="https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/gromacs-2022-advances-open-source-drug-discovery-with-oneapi/">GROMACS</a>,
 one of the most popular scientific research applications in the world,
