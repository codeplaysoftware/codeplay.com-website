Codeplay's mission is to build the largest open ecosystem for accelerator computing target. To achieve this, we provide
tools and implementations to support heterogeneous languages on a wide range of accelerator hardware.

## Responsibilities

- Work on designing and implementing new runtime language features, for SYCL, OpenCL or similar programming models.
- Write performant implementation of language features
- Work on designing and implementing parallel language runtime APIs for any of the following (but not limited to):
  - SYCL language runtime.
  - Unified Runtime and LLVM liboffload.
- Implementing runtimes on top of vendor specific heterogeneous APIs.
- Profile, benchmark and optimise parallel language implementations for execution or compile times.
- Debug and fix reported bugs.
- Potentially contribute to relevant standards bodies, e.g. Khronos working groups for SYCL, OpenCL, and SPIR-V.
- Contribute to testing and CI in a variety of environments and platforms (Windows/Linux)
- Contribute to project documentation.
- Work within an agile software development team.
- Share knowledge with other engineers in your team and in the company.

## Required Skills

The ideal candidate is a self-motivated individual who can work through a problem from start to finish, meet deadlines
as required to support software projects, and has the ability to work under pressure. In this role you will be working
on technology that is seldom announced to the public and could be several years away from public release, so
confidentiality is critical. You should be able to work both independently and collaboratively within teams of varying
skill sets and expertise. You should be welcoming towards, and able to adapt to, the introduction of new technologies,
responsibilities and projects, as Codeplay works with cutting-edge technology and takes on a diverse range of projects.

- Good working knowledge of C++ (e.g. usage of post C++11 constructs, familiarity with STL containers, etc).
- Experience with tooling such as build systems and source control.
- Ability to develop robust, maintainable, efficient and testable code for secure and reliable systems.
- Develop correct, fast and scalable multithreaded and parallel programs.
- Learn new technologies and development approaches on the job, via code reviews, team collaboration or self study.
- Excellent communication skills, both verbal and written.
- Mentor junior engineers during pair or mob programming sessions, code reviews or any other collaboration opportunity.
- Experience working on a parallel or heterogeneous language runtime.
- Experience working with SYCL/CUDA/OpenCL/HIP or any other GPU programming API

## Beneficial Skills

Knowledge and/or experience of any of the following would be useful for the role, but are not essential. You must be
able to learn new skills, but will be given support from Codeplayâ€™s team to get you up to speed.

- Experience working on compilers, particularly the Clang/LLVM projects.
- SYCL, OpenCL, CUDA, Vulkan, etc.
- HLSL/GLSL/other shading language environments.
- Knowledge of SPIR-V intermediate language.
- Craft cross-platform (Various Linux flavours, Windows) solutions.
- OS-level and/or driver development.
- Object file formats.
- Experience profiling and optimising performance and memory system usage.
- Experience contributing to standard bodies (e.g. contribution to Khronos extensions)

## What We Offer

Codeplay Software is a world pioneer in enabling acceleration technologies used in AI, HPC and automotive. Codeplay was
established in 2002 in Edinburgh, Scotland and developed some of the first tools enabling complex software to be
accelerated using graphics processors. Today, most AI software is developed using graphics processors designed for video
games, and more recently specialised AI and computer vision accelerators. Codeplay is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Intel.

- A friendly and relaxed working environment where colleagues respect and support each other.
- Learn from experienced colleagues: our staff frequently give company-wide knowledge-sharing presentations on new 
  software and technology trends, personal projects and other relevant subjects.
- New start mentoring scheme
- Flexible working hours
