<p>We are looking for a Research Engineer who is interested in helping us leverage accelerators to support AI research.</p><p>Codeplay R&amp;D is active in building&nbsp;compiler infrastructure,&nbsp;tools, libraries, frameworks, services, and products to enable and accelerate the next generation of research ideas. In the simplest form, improving the workflow has a super-linear impact on research efficiency, as not only does it free up more time - but the extra cognitive space can allow new research ideas to thrive that would otherwise never happen. Many recent breakthroughs in AI research&nbsp;were made possible by the vast amounts of computational power from new hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPU, and AO related accelerators. As a Research Engineer, you can help us enhance and expand our AI software stack for various hardware accelerators and make it easy to use efficiently for our existing/future customers.&nbsp;</p><p>Codeplay research relies on enabling Codeplay products on exciting/new hardware platforms and developing new ideas that can be later converted into products.&nbsp;The future of hardware is heterogeneous, with combinations of CPUs and accelerators, with ad-hoc software layers &amp; APIs to program them. They can be hard to use effectively. Your job is to work across the backend of our HPC/AI software stack to enable our technologies to make faster progress towards our mission. You will look at all components that influence performance: from HPC and AI frameworks to compilers, to hardware and even distributed computing and networking.</p><h2>Responsibilities -</h2><ul><li>Taking the initiative and assume responsibility for solving technical problems.&nbsp;</li><li>Working well within teams on multi-person software projects and/or on open-source projects.&nbsp;</li><li>Documenting software and standard methodologies.&nbsp;</li><li>Communicating your ideas, your work, and your results to team members, team leaders and senior managers.&nbsp;</li><li>Writing accelerators-based kernels like GPUs, that achieves high levels of throughput and efficiency with your implementations.&nbsp;</li><li>Profiling software running on GPUs, using appropriate tools and techniques to find performance issues &amp; bottlenecks.&nbsp;</li><li>Working towards expanding state-of-the compiler graph technologies for AI to target different architecture/languages</li><li>Driving multiple stages of software projects - from requirements gatherings to launch and validation.&nbsp;</li><li>Looking for what can be improved, and having a proactive attitude in helping our researchers</li><li>Participating in technical discussions, asking insightful questions, and working with the team to pull together scoping, schedules, and solutions to issues</li><li>Having an interest in our mission and AI/Machine Learning.</li><li>Writing papers, technical reports, presentation</li><li>Hands-on experience on compiler technologies</li></ul><p>Please Note: Due to COVID-19 we are following the Scottish Government Roadmap and, although we are operating normally, the office is closed and we are all working from home.</p><p>The successful candidate should be able to work from home for the duration of the office closure. The position is permanent and may be based at our&nbsp;<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/SexqmVVjJHm">head office</a>&nbsp;in central Edinburgh. The successful candidate must be able to demonstrate the right to work in the UK, or be eligible to apply for the right to work, should relocation be an agreed option. Fully remote working is also an option for this position.</p><h2>What We Offer</h2><p>Codeplay is a world pioneer in enabling acceleration technologies used in AI, HPC and automotive. Codeplay was established in 2002 in Edinburgh, Scotland and developed some of the first tools enabling complex software to be accelerated using graphics processors. Today, most AI software is developed using graphics processors designed for video games, and more recently specialised AI and computer vision accelerators. Codeplay continues to work with global technology leaders to make the latest complex AI systems programmable using open-standards-based programming languages and allows application developers to quickly bring software to the market.&nbsp; Codeplay is also deeply involved with the definition of open&nbsp;standards, especially&nbsp;OpenCL™, SPIR™, SYCL™, and Vulkan™ through The Khronos Group, and MISRA C++ for automotive.</p><p>Codeplay is internationally recognized as being at the forefront of software development technology. Working at Codeplay offers unique opportunities and challenges to learn new technologies and to get involved in shaping the software industry. Codeplay's projects range from: creating tools and toolsets (optimizing compilers, debuggers, profilers, programming models &amp; APIs, test systems/suites, etc.) for brand-new unannounced next-generation hardware; developing and optimizing current machine learning (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow™</a>) and computer vision applications; research and development into lowering the power consumption of mobile devices; and contributing to new programming models and software standards (e.g. C++,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.khronos.org/sycl/">SYCL™</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL™</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/">Vulkan®</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.khronos.org/spir/">SPIR™-V</a>).</p><p></p><ul><li>A friendly and relaxed working environment where colleagues respect and support each other.</li><li>Learn from experienced colleagues: our staff frequently give company-wide knowledge-sharing presentations on new software and technology trends, personal projects and other relevant subjects.</li><li>Great career prospects within a growing company<ul><li>We develop our staff to progress quickly in their roles, and to take ownership of business functions, become experts, and/or lead teams.
