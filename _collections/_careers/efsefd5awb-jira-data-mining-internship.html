<p>Codeplay is known for implementing OpenCL™ and SYCL™ runtimes and compilers for their customers' acceleration platforms. Now we aim to target customers in the automotive sector, who want to run highly complex AI algorithms on their accelerators, which will provide advanced driving assistance (ADAS) and autonomous driving (AD) features to make our roads safer. To support these customers Codeplay needs to ensure that the code is sufficiently safe. The safety is ensured primarily by static analysis, manual review and testing. However, in anything but a trivial code base it is not possible to undertake these to 100% coverage, so a representative sample has to be chosen. Being able to predict which modules are likely to contain bugs helps direct these efforts to the places where they are most valuable.</p><p>Codeplay's software has been in development for many years and we have therefore accrued a lot of data in the form of bug reports, merge requests and git revisions. This data encodes historical information such as the prevalence of defects per module. By extrapolating this data we can estimate the number of bugs remaining in the software as well as predict which parts of the code are likely to contain more bugs.</p><p><strong>Please Note</strong>: Due to COVID-19 we are following the Scottish Government Roadmap and, although we are operating normally, we have not yet returned to the office.</p><p>The successful candidate should be able to work from home for the duration of the office closure. The position is a temporary internship. The successful candidate must be able to demonstrate the existing right to work in the UK.</p><p>Although this internship is on offer for a duration of 3-6 months, we are delighted to accept applications for longer internships and many of our interns have stayed with us to do university placement years or have become permanent members of our team.</p><h2>Responsibilities</h2><ul><li>Performing data mining of our software repositories through the Jira issue tracker.</li><li>Creating scripts that call into Jira's API, to extract data such as the defect rate of different areas of code, the defect rate of code produced by different developers, etc.</li><li>Optionally, extracting additional metrics from the code, such as complexity or comment density, and try to establish a correlation between them and the defect rate.</li><li>Writing a blog post describing the techniques and some high-level results.</li></ul><h2>What We Offer</h2><p>Codeplay is internationally recognized as being at the forefront of software development technology. Working at Codeplay offers unique opportunities and challenges to learn new technologies and to get involved in shaping the software industry. Codeplay's projects range from: creating tools and tool sets (optimizing compilers, debuggers, profilers, programming models &amp; APIs, test systems/suites, etc.) for brand-new unannounced next-generation hardware; developing and optimizing current machine learning (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow™</a>) and computer vision applications; research and development into lowering the power consumption of mobile devices; and contributing to new programming models and software standards (e.g. C++, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/sycl/">SYCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL™</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/">Vulkan®</a> and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/spir/">SPIR™-V</a>).</p><p>Codeplay Software is a world pioneer in enabling acceleration technologies used in AI, HPC and automotive. Codeplay was established in 2002 in Edinburgh, Scotland and developed some of the first tools enabling complex software to be accelerated using graphics processors. Today, most AI software is developed using graphics processors designed for video games, and more recently specialised AI and computer vision accelerators. Codeplay continues to work with global technology leaders to make the latest complex AI systems programmable using open-standards based programming languages and allows application developers to quickly bring software to the market.&nbsp; Codeplay is also deeply involved with the definition of open&nbsp;standards, especially&nbsp;OpenCL™, SPIR™, SYCL™, and Vulkan™ through The Khronos Group, and MISRA C++ for automotive.</p><ul><li>A friendly and relaxed working environment where colleagues respect and support each other.</li><li>Learn from experienced colleagues: our staff frequently give company-wide knowledge-sharing presentations on new software and technology trends, personal projects and other relevant subjects.</li><li>Great career prospects within a growing company</li><li>Newstart mentoring scheme</li><li>Flexible working hours</li><li>Frequent company social events (social nights, pot luck lunches, gaming, karting, outdoor adventures, and more) (Post-COVID!)</li></ul><h2>Required Skills</h2><p>The ideal candidate is a self-motivated individual who can work through a problem from start to finish, meet deadlines as required to support software projects, and has the ability to work under pressure. You will be working on technology that is seldom announced to the public and could be several years away from public release, so confidentiality is critical. You should be able to work both independently and collaboratively within teams of varying skill sets and expertise. You should be welcoming towards, and able to adapt to, the introduction of new technologies, responsibilities and projects, as Codeplay works with cutting-edge technology and takes on a diverse range of projects.</p><ul><li>Scripting experience, such as Python</li></ul><h2>Beneficial Skills</h2><p>Knowledge and/or experience of any of the following would be useful for the role, but are not essential. You must be able to learn new skills, but will be given support from Codeplay's team to get you up to speed.</p><ul><li>Experience with the Jira issue tracker</li><li>Experience with the Jira API</li><li>Experience with Git</li><li>Experience with GitLab</li></ul><h2>Application Guidance</h2><p>Any application which results in a job offer is conditional upon the candidate already having or successfully applying for the right to work in the UK.
